<h2 class="chapter">THE STORY OF BLONDINE, BONNE-BICHE,<br />
AND BEAU-MINON</h2>

<h3 class="chapter2"><a name="BLONDINE" id="BLONDINE"></a>BLONDINE</h3>

<p><span class="dropcap">T</span><span class="upper">here</span> was once a king called Benin. He was good<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
and all the world loved him; he was just and the
wicked feared him. His wife, the Queen Doucette,
was also good, and much beloved.</p>

<p>This happy pair had a daughter called the Princess
Blondine, because of her superb fair hair, and she was as
amiable and charming as her father the king and her mother
the queen.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, the poor queen died a short time after
the birth of Blondine and for a long time the king wept bitterly
at his great loss. Blondine was too young to under<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>stand
her mother's death: she did not weep but continued to
laugh, to play and to sleep peacefully. The king loved her
tenderly and she loved him more than all the world. He
gave his little daughter the most beautiful jewels, the finest
bonbons, and the most rare and delicious fruits. Blondine
was very happy.</p>

<p>One day it was announced to the king, that all his subjects
demanded that he should marry again in order to have
a son who should reign after him. He refused at first but
finally yielded to the pressing desires of his people and said
to his minister Leger:&mdash;</p>

<p>"My dear friend, my subjects wish me to marry again
but my heart is so sad because of the death of my cherished
queen Doucette that I cannot undertake the task of seeking
another wife. Go, then, my good Leger and find me a princess
who will make my sweet Blondine happy. Go; I ask
for nothing more. When you have found a perfect woman,
you will demand her hand in marriage and conduct her to
my court."</p>

<p>Leger set off immediately, visited many courts and saw
innumerable princesses&mdash;ugly, humpbacked and wicked.</p>

<p>At last he arrived at the kingdom of the monarch Turbulent,
who had a lovely daughter, bright, winning and apparently
good. Leger found her so charming, that he asked
her hand in marriage for his king Benin, without sufficiently
inquiring into her real character.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span></p>

<div class="caption"><i>Leger meets the wicked princess, Fourbette</i></div>
<div class="minispace">&nbsp;</div>

<p>Turbulent was enchanted at the prospect of getting rid
of his daughter who was jealous, proud and wicked. Also,
her presence often interfered with his excursions for pleasure,
with the chase and with his various entertainments at the
palace.</p>

<p>Without a moment's hesitation, he acceded to the Prime
Minister's request, and he returned with the princess to the
kingdom of the good king Benin.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span></p>

<p>The princess Fourbette was accompanied by four thousand
mules, loaded with the jewels and wardrobe of the
charming bride.</p>

<p>King Benin had been apprised of their approach by
a courier and went forward to receive the princess Fourbette.
He found her beautiful but he noted the absence
of the mild and attractive expression of the poor lost Doucette.</p>

<p>When Fourbette's eyes fell upon Blondine her glance
was so cruel, so wicked, that the poor child, who was now
three years old, was greatly terrified and began to weep bitterly.</p>

<p>"What is the matter?" said the king. "Why does my
sweet and sensible Blondine weep like a bad little girl?"</p>

<p>"Papa! dear papa!" cried Blondine, throwing herself
into the arms of the king, "do not give me into the hands of
this princess. I am afraid of her&mdash;her eyes are cruel!"</p>

<p>The king was much surprised. He turned so suddenly
towards the princess Fourbette that she had no time to control
herself and he perceived the terrible glance with which
she regarded the little Blondine.</p>

<p>Benin immediately resolved that Blondine should be
wholly separated from the new queen and remain as before
under the exclusive protection of the nurse who had taken
care of her and who loved her tenderly.</p>

<p>The queen thus saw Blondine rarely, and when she met<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
her by chance she could not wholly dissimulate the hatred
she felt for her.</p>

<p>About a year from that time a daughter was born to the
queen Fourbette. She was named Brunette, because of her
dark hair which was black as the raven's wing.</p>

<p>Brunette was pretty but not so lovely as Blondine; moreover
she was as wicked as her mother. She detested Blondine
and played all sorts of cruel tricks upon her, bit her,
pinched her, pulled her hair, broke her toys and tore her
beautiful dresses.</p>

<p>The good little Blondine was never in a passion with
her sister but always tried to make excuses for her conduct.</p>

<p>"Oh, papa!" she said to the king, "do not scold Brunette;
she is so little! she does not know that she grieves me
when she breaks my toys! It is only in play that she bites
me, pulls my hair and pinches me."</p>

<p>The good king embraced his little daughter, and was
silent but he knew that Brunette was cruel and wicked; that
Blondine was too gentle and good to accuse her. He loved
Blondine, therefore, more and more from day to day and his
heart grew cold to Brunette.</p>

<p>The ambitious queen Fourbette saw all this clearly and
hated intensely the innocent and gentle Blondine. If she
had not feared the rage of the king she would have made
Blondine the most wretched child in the world.</p>

<p>Benin had commanded that Blondine should never be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
left alone with the queen. He was known to be just and
good but he punished disobedience severely and the queen
herself dared not defy his commands.</p>

<h3 class="chapter2"><a name="BLONDINE_LOST" id="BLONDINE_LOST"></a>BLONDINE LOST</h3>


<p><span class="dropcap">B</span><span class="upper">londine</span> grew to be seven years old and Brunette<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
three.</p>

<p>The king had given Blondine a charming little
carriage drawn by ostriches, and a little coachman ten years
of age, who was the nephew of her nurse.</p>

<p>The little page, who was called Gourmandinet, loved
Blondine tenderly. He had been her playmate from her
birth and she had shown him a thousand acts of kindness.</p>

<p>But Gourmandinet had one terrible fault; he was a
gourmand&mdash;was so fond of dainties and sweet things, that
for a paper of bonbons he would commit almost any wicked
action. Blondine often said to him:</p>

<p>"I love you dearly, Gourmandinet, but I do not love to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
see you so greedy. I entreat you to correct this villainous
fault which will make you despised by all the world."</p>

<p>Gourmandinet kissed her hand and promised to reform.
But, alas! he continued to steal cakes from the kitchen and
bonbons from the store-room. Often, indeed, he was
whipped for his disobedience and gluttony.</p>

<p>The queen Fourbette heard on every hand the reproaches
lavished upon the page and she was cunning
enough to think that she might make use of this weakness of
Gourmandinet and thus get rid of poor Blondine.</p>

<p>The garden in which Blondine drove in her little carriage,
drawn by ostriches and guided by her little coachman,
Gourmandinet, was separated by a grating from an immense
and magnificent forest, called the Forest of Lilacs because
during the whole year these lilacs were always covered with
superb flowers.</p>

<p>No one, however, entered these woods. It was well
known that it was enchanted ground and that if you once
entered there you could never hope to escape.</p>

<p>Gourmandinet knew the terrible secret of this forest.
He had been severely forbidden ever to drive the carriage of
Blondine in that direction lest by some chance Blondine
might pass the grating and place her little feet on the enchanted
ground.</p>

<p>Many times the king Benin had sought to build a wall
the entire length of the grating or to secure it in some way<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
so as to make an entrance there impossible. But the workmen
had no sooner laid the foundation than some unknown
and invisible power raised the stones and they disappeared
from sight.</p>

<p>The queen Fourbette now sought diligently to gain the
friendship of Gourmandinet by giving him every day some
delicious dainties. In this way she made him so complete a
slave to his appetite that he could not live without the jellies,
bonbons and cakes which she gave him in such profusion.
At last she sent for him to come to her, and said:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Gourmandinet, it depends entirely upon yourself
whether you shall have a large trunk full of bonbons and delicious
dainties or never again eat one during your life."</p>

<p>"Never again eat one! Oh! madam, I should die of
such punishment. Speak, madam, what must I do to escape
this terrible fate?"</p>

<p>"It is necessary," said the queen, looking at him fixedly,
"that you should drive the princess Blondine near to the
Forest of Lilacs."</p>

<p>"I cannot do it, madam; the king has forbidden it."</p>

<p>"Ah! you cannot do it; well, then, adieu. No more
dainties for you. I shall command every one in the house to
give you nothing."</p>

<p>"Oh! madam," said Gourmandinet, weeping bitterly,
"do not be so cruel. Give me some order which it is in my
power to execute."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span></p>

<p>"I can only repeat that I command you to lead the princess
Blondine near to the Forest of Lilacs; that you encourage
her to descend from the carriage, to cross the grating
and enter the enchanted ground."</p>

<p>"But, madam," replied Gourmandinet, turning very
pale, "if the princess enters this forest she can never escape
from it. You know the penalty of entering upon enchanted
ground. To send my dear princess there is to give her up
to certain death."</p>

<p>"For the third and last time," said the queen, frowning
fearfully, "I ask if you will take the princess to the forest?
Choose! either an immense box of bonbons which I will renew
every month or never again to taste the delicacies which
you love."</p>

<p>"But how shall I escape from the dreadful punishment
which his majesty will inflict upon me?"</p>

<p>"Do not be disquieted on that account. As soon as you
have induced Blondine to enter the Forest of Lilacs, return
to me. I will send you off out of danger with your bonbons,
and I charge myself with your future fortune."</p>

<p>"Oh! madam, have pity upon me. Do not compel me
to lead my dear princess to destruction. She who has always
been so good to me!"</p>

<p>"You still hesitate, miserable coward! Of what importance
is the fate of Blondine to you? When you have
obeyed my commands I will see that you enter the service of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
Brunette and I declare to you solemnly that the bonbons shall
never fail."</p>

<p>Gourmandinet hesitated and reflected a few moments
longer and, alas! at last resolved to sacrifice his good little
mistress to his gluttony.</p>

<p>The remainder of that day he still hesitated and he lay
awake all night weeping bitter tears as he endeavored to discover
some way to escape from the power of the wicked
queen; but the certainty of the queen's bitter revenge if he
refused to execute her cruel orders, and the hope of rescuing
Blondine at some future day by seeking the aid of some powerful
fairy, conquered his irresolution and decided him to
obey the queen.</p>

<p>In the morning at ten o'clock Blondine ordered her little
carriage and entered it for a drive, after having embraced
the king her father and promised him to return in two hours.</p>

<p>The garden was immense. Gourmandinet, on starting,
turned the ostriches away from the Forest of Lilacs. When,
however, they were entirely out of sight of the palace, he
changed his course and turned towards the grating which
separated them from the enchanted ground. He was sad
and silent. His crime weighed upon his heart and conscience.</p>

<p>"What is the matter?" said Blondine, kindly. "You
say nothing Are you ill, Gourmandinet?"</p>

<p>"No, my princess, I am well."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span></p>

<p>"But how pale you are! Tell me what distresses you,
poor boy, and I promise to do all in my power to make you
happy."</p>

<p>Blondine's kind inquiries and attentions almost softened
the hard heart of Gourmandinet, but the remembrance of the
bonbons promised by the wicked queen, Fourbette, soon
chased away his good resolutions. Before he had time to reply,
the ostriches reached the grating of the Forest of Lilacs.</p>

<p>"Oh! the beautiful lilacs!" exclaimed Blondine; "how
fragrant&mdash;how delicious! I must have a bouquet of those
beautiful flowers for my good papa. Get down, Gourmandinet
and bring me some of those superb branches."</p>

<p>"I cannot leave my seat, princess, the ostriches might
run away with you during my absence."</p>

<p>"Do not fear," replied Blondine; "I could guide them
myself to the palace."</p>

<p>"But the king would give me a terrible scolding for having
abandoned you, princess. It is best that you go yourself
and gather your flowers."</p>

<p>"That is true. I should be very sorry to get you a scolding,
my poor Gourmandinet."</p>

<p>While saying these words she sprang lightly from the
carriage, crossed the bars of the grating and commenced to
gather the flowers.</p>

<p>At this moment Gourmandinet shuddered and was overwhelmed
with remorse. He wished to repair his fault by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
calling Blondine but although she was only ten steps from
him,&mdash;although he saw her perfectly&mdash;she could not hear his
voice, and in a short time she was lost to view in the enchanted
forest.</p>

<p>For a long time Gourmandinet wept over his crime,
cursed his gluttony and despised the wicked queen Fourbette.</p>

<p>At last he recalled to himself that the hour approached
at which Blondine would be expected at the palace. He returned
to the stables through the back entrance and ran at
once to the queen, who was anxiously expecting him.</p>

<p>On seeing him so deadly pale and his eyes inflamed from
the tears of awful remorse, she knew that Blondine had perished.</p>

<p>"Is it done?" said she.</p>

<p>Gourmandinet bowed his head. He had not the
strength to speak.</p>

<p>"Come," said she, "behold your reward!"</p>

<p>She pointed to a large box full of delicious bonbons of
every variety. She commanded a valet to raise the box
and place it upon one of the mules which had brought her
jewelry.</p>

<p>"I confide this box to Gourmandinet, in order that he
may take it to my father," she said. "Go, boy, and return in
a month for another." She placed in his hand at the same
time a purse full of gold.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span></p>

<p>Gourmandinet mounted the mule in perfect silence and
set off in full gallop. The mule was obstinate and wilful
and soon grew restive under the weight of the box and began
to prance and kick. He did this so effectually that he threw
Gourmandinet and his precious box of bonbons upon the
ground.</p>

<p>Gourmandinet, who had never ridden upon a horse or
mule, fell heavily with his head upon the stones and died
instantly.</p>

<p>Thus he did not receive from his crime the profit which
he had hoped, for he had not even tasted of the bonbons
which the queen had given him.</p>

<p>No one regretted him. No one but the poor Blondine
had ever loved him.</p>

<h3 class="chapter2"><a name="THE_FOREST_OF_LILACS" id="THE_FOREST_OF_LILACS"></a>THE FOREST OF LILACS</h3>


<p><span class="dropcap">W</span><span class="upper">hen</span> Blondine entered the forest she commenced<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
gathering the beautiful branches of
lilacs. She rejoiced in their profusion and
delighted in their fragrance.</p>

<p>As she made her selection, it seemed to her that those
which were more distant were still more beautiful so she
emptied her apron and her hat, which were both full and
filled them again and again.</p>

<p>Blondine had been thus busily occupied for about an
hour. She began to suffer from the heat and to feel great
fatigue. She found the branches of lilacs heavy to carry and
thought it was time to return to the palace. She looked
around and saw herself surrounded with lilacs. She called
Gourmandinet but no one replied.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span></p>

<p>"I have wandered further than I intended," said Blondine.
"I will return at once, though I am very weary.
Gourmandinet will hear me and will surely come to meet
me."</p>

<p>Blondine walked on rapidly for some time but she could
not find the boundaries of the forest.</p>

<p>Many times she called anxiously upon Gourmandinet
but he did not respond and at last she became terribly frightened.</p>

<p>"What will become of me, all alone in this vast forest?
What will my poor papa think when I do not return? And
Gourmandinet, how will he dare go back to the palace without
me? He will be scolded, perhaps beaten and all this is
my fault because I would leave my carriage to gather lilacs?
Unfortunate girl that I am! I shall die of hunger and thirst
in this forest if the wolves do not eat me up this night."</p>

<p>Weeping bitterly, Blondine fell on the ground at the
foot of a large tree. She wept a long time. At last her great
fatigue mastered her grief. She placed her little head upon
her bundle of lilacs, and slept peacefully.</p>

<h3 class="chapter2"><a name="BLONDINES_AWAKENING_BEAU-MINON" id="BLONDINES_AWAKENING_BEAU-MINON"></a>BLONDINE'S AWAKENING&mdash;BEAU-MINON</h3>


<p><span class="dropcap">B</span><span class="upper">londine</span> slept calmly all night; no ferocious beast<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
came to trouble her slumbers. She did not suffer
from the cold and awakened at a late hour in the
morning. She rubbed her eyes, much surprised to see herself
surrounded by trees, in place of being in her own room
in the palace, and upon her own bed.</p>

<p>She called her nurse and a soft mewing was the only response.
Astonished and almost frightened, she looked
around and saw at her feet a superb white cat, looking gently
upon her and continuing to mew plaintively.</p>

<p>"Ah! pretty puss! how beautiful you are!" cried Blondine,
placing her little hand caressingly upon the soft fur,
white as snow. "I am so happy to see you, pretty puss, for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
you will conduct me to your home. I am indeed very hungry
and I have not the strength to walk much further without
food."</p>

<p>Blondine had scarcely uttered these words, when the
white pussy mewed again and pointed with her little paw to
a small package lying near her, wrapped neatly in fine white
linen. She opened the parcel and found it contained bread
and butter which she found delicious. She gave the crumbs
to pussy, who munched them with seeming delight.</p>

<p>When they had finished their simple meal, Blondine
leaned over towards her little companion, and said, caressingly:</p>

<p>"Thanks, pretty puss, for the breakfast you have given
me. Now, can you conduct me to my papa, who is certainly
in despair because of my absence?"</p>

<p>Pussy, whom Blondine named Beau-Minon, shook her
head and mewed plaintively.</p>

<p>"Ah! you understand me, Beau-Minon," said Blondine.
"I entreat you to have pity upon me and lead me to
some house before I perish with hunger, cold and terror in
this vast forest!"</p>

<p>Beau-Minon looked at the princess fixedly and made a
sign with her little graceful white head which seemed to say,
"I understand you." She rose, advanced a few steps and
paused to see if Blondine followed her.</p>

<p>"I am here, Beau-Minon; I am following you gladly,"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
said Blondine; "but how can we pass through these bushy
thickets? I see no path."</p>

<p>Beau-Minon made no reply but sprang lightly into the
thicket which opened of itself to allow Blondine and Beau-Minon
to pass, and then closed up immediately.</p>

<p>Blondine walked on for about half an hour. As she advanced,
the forest became lighter, the grass was finer and the
flowers more abundant. She saw many pretty birds singing
melodiously and graceful squirrels, bounding along the
branches of the trees.</p>

<p>Blondine, who had no doubt that she was about to leave
the forest and see her dear father again, was enchanted with
all that she saw; she wished to pause and gather the lovely
wild flowers; but Beau-Minon advanced steadily and
mewed plaintively whenever Blondine relaxed her speed.</p>

<p>In about an hour Blondine perceived an elegant castle.
Beau-Minon led her to the gilded grating. However, Blondine
did not know how to enter. There was no bell and
the gate was closed. Beau-Minon had disappeared and
Blondine was once more alone.</p>

<h3 class="chapter2"><a name="BONNE_BICHE" id="BONNE_BICHE"></a>BONNE-BICHE</h3>


<p><span class="dropcap">B</span><span class="upper">eau-Minon</span> had entered by a little passage, which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
seemed made expressly for him and had probably
given notice to some one at the castle, as the gate
opened without Blondine having called.</p>

<p>She entered the court-yard but saw no one.</p>

<p>The door of the castle opened of itself. Blondine entered
the vestibule which was of rare white marble. All the
doors of the castle now opened like the first and the princess
passed through a suite of beautiful rooms.</p>

<p>At last, in the back part of a charming salon, furnished
with blue and gold, she perceived a white hind, lying upon
a bed of fine and fragrant grasses. Beau-Minon stood near
her. The pretty hind saw Blondine, arose, and approached
her.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span></p>

<p>"You are most welcome, Blondine," said she. "My son
Beau-Minon and I have expected you for a long time."</p>

<p>At these words, Blondine was much frightened.</p>

<p>"Take courage, princess; you are with friends. I
know the king your father and I love him and I love you
also."</p>

<p>"Oh, madam," said Blondine, "if you know the king my
father, I pray you to take me to him. My absence must
make him very wretched."</p>

<p>"My dear Blondine," said the hind, whose name was
Bonne-Biche, sighing, "it is not in my power to conduct you
to your father. You are in the hands of the magician of the
Forest of Lilacs. I myself am subject to his power which is
superior to mine but I can send soft dreams to your father,
which will reassure him as to your fate and let him know that
you are safe with me."</p>

<p>"Oh, madam!" said Blondine, in an agony of grief,
"shall I never again see my father whom I love so tenderly?
My poor father!"</p>

<p>"Dear Blondine, do not distress yourself as to the future.
Wisdom and prudence are always recompensed. You will
see your father again but not now. In the meantime be
good and docile. Beau-Minon and I will do all in our
power to make you happy."</p>

<p>Blondine sighed heavily and shed a few tears. She then
reflected that to manifest such grief was a poor recompense<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
for all the goodness of Bonne-Biche. She resolved, therefore,
to control herself and to be cheerful.</p>

<p>Bonne-Biche took her to see the apartment they had prepared
for her. The bedroom was hung with rose-colored
silk embroidered with gold. The furniture was covered
with white velvet worked with silks of the most brilliant
hues. Every species of animal, bird and butterfly were represented
in rare embroidery.</p>

<p>Adjoining Blondine's chamber was a small study. It
was hung with sky-blue damask, embroidered with fine pearls.
The furniture was covered with silver moir&eacute;, adorned with
nails of turquoise. Two magnificent portraits, representing
a young and superbly handsome woman and a strikingly attractive
young man, hung on the walls. Their costumes indicated
that they were of royal race.</p>

<p>"Whose portraits are these, madam?" said Blondine to
Bonne-Biche.</p>

<p>"I am forbidden to answer that question, dear Blondine.
You will know later;&mdash;but this is the hour for dinner.
Come, Blondine, I am sure you are hungry."</p>

<p>Blondine was in fact almost dying of hunger. She followed
Bonne-Biche and they entered the dining-room where
she saw a table strangely served.</p>

<p>An enormous cushion of black satin was placed on the
floor for Bonne-Biche. On the table before her was a vase
filled with the choicest herbs, fresh and nutritious and near<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
this vase was a golden bucket, filled with fresh and limpid
water.</p>

<p>Opposite Bonne-Biche was a little stool for Beau-Minon
while before him was a little porringer in gold, filled with
little fried fish and the thighs of snipes. At one side was a
bowl of rich crystal full of fresh milk.</p>

<p>Between Beau-Minon and Bonne-Biche a plate was
placed for Blondine. Her chair was of carved ivory covered
with crimson velvet attached with nails of diamonds.
Before her was a gold plate richly chased, filled with delicious
soup made of a young pullet and fig-birds, her glass
and water-bottle were of carved rock-crystal, a muffin was
placed by her side, her fork and spoon were of gold and her
napkin was of linen, finer than anything she had ever seen.</p>

<p>The table was served by gazelles who were marvellously
adroit. They waited, carved and even divined the wishes of
Blondine, Bonne-Biche and Beau-Minon. The dinner was
exquisite&mdash;the chicken was splendid, the game and fish most
delicate, the pastry and bonbons superlative. Blondine was
hungry so she ate of all and found all excellent.</p>

<p>After dinner, Bonne-Biche and Beau-Minon conducted
the princess into the garden. She found there the most delicious
fruits and lovely walks.</p>

<p>After a charming walk, Blondine entered the castle with
her new friends, much fatigued. Bonne-Biche proposed
that she retire, to which she agreed joyfully.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span></p>

<p>Blondine entered her chamber and found two gazelles
waiting to attend her. They disrobed her with grace and
adroitness, placed her in bed and seated themselves by her
couch to watch over her.</p>

<p>Blondine was soon peacefully asleep&mdash;not, however,
without having first thought of her father and wept bitterly
over her cruel separation from him.</p>

<h3 class="chapter2"><a name="BLONDINES_SECOND_AWAKENING" id="BLONDINES_SECOND_AWAKENING"></a>BLONDINE'S SECOND AWAKENING</h3>


<p><span class="dropcap">B</span><span class="upper">londine</span> slept profoundly, and on awaking she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
found herself entirely changed. Indeed, it seemed
to her she could not be the same person. She was
much taller, her intellect was developed, her knowledge enlarged.
She remembered a number of books she thought
she had read during her sleep. She was sure she had been
writing, drawing, singing and playing on the piano and
harp.</p>

<p>She looked around, however, and knew that the chamber
was the same to which Bonne-Biche had conducted her
and in which she had gone to sleep.</p>

<p>Agitated, disquieted, she rose and ran to the glass. She
saw that she was much grown and she found herself charm<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>ing,
a hundred times more beautiful than when she retired
the night before. Her fair ringlets fell to her feet, her complexion
was like the lily and the rose, her eyes celestial blue,
her nose beautifully formed, her cheeks rosy as the morn, and
her form was erect and graceful. In short, Blondine
thought herself the most beautiful person she had ever seen.</p>

<p>Trembling, almost frightened, she dressed herself hastily
and ran to seek Bonne-Biche whom she found in the
apartment where she had first seen her.</p>

<p>"Bonne-Biche, Bonne-Biche!" she exclaimed, "I entreat
you to explain to me the change which I see and feel in myself.
Last night I went to sleep a child&mdash;I awoke this morning,
and found myself a young lady. Is this an illusion or
have I indeed grown and developed thus during the night?"</p>

<p>"Yes, my dear Blondine, you are fourteen years old to-day.
But you have slept peacefully seven years. My son
Beau-Minon and I wished to spare you the weariness of all
early studies. When you first entered the castle you knew
nothing; not even how to read. I put you to sleep for seven
years, and Beau-Minon and I have passed this time in instructing
you during your sleep. I see by the wonder expressed
in your eyes, sweet princess, that you doubt all this.
Come into your study and reassure yourself on this point."</p>

<p>Blondine followed Bonne-Biche to the little room. She
ran first to the piano, commenced playing and found that
she played remarkably well. She then tried the harp and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
drew from it the most ravishing sounds, and she sang enchantingly.</p>

<p>She took her pencil and brushes and drew and painted
with a facility which denoted a true talent. She wrote and
found her handwriting clear and elegant. She looked at the
countless books which were ranged round the room and
knew that she had read them all.</p>

<p>Surprised, delighted, she threw her arms around the
neck of Bonne-Biche, embraced Beau-Minon tenderly and
said to them:</p>

<p>"Oh! my dear true good friends, what a debt of gratitude
do I owe you for having thus watched over my childhood
and developed my intellect and my heart. I feel how
much I am improved in every respect and I owe it all to
you."</p>

<p>Bonne-Biche returned her caresses and Beau-Minon
patted her hand delicately. After the first few happy moments
had passed, Blondine cast down her eyes and said timidly:</p>

<p>"Do not think me ungrateful, my dear good friends,
if I wish you to add one more to the benefits you have already
conferred upon me. Tell me something of my father.
Does he still weep my absence? Is he happy since he lost
me?"</p>

<p>"Dear Blondine, your anxiety on this point is most natural
and shall be relieved. Look in this mirror, Blondine,
and you shall see the king your father and all that has passed
since you left the palace."</p>

<div class="minispace">&nbsp;</div>

<div class="caption"><i>She threw her arms around the neck of Bonne-Biche</i></div>
<div class="minispace">&nbsp;</div>

<p>Blondine raised her eyes to the mirror and looked into<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
the apartment of her father. The king seemed much agitated
and was walking backwards and forwards. He appeared
to be expecting some one. The queen, Fourbette,
entered and related to him that notwithstanding the remonstrances
of Gourmandinet, Blondine had herself seized the
reins and guided the ostriches who becoming frightened
dashed off in the direction of the Forest of Lilacs and overturned
the carriage. Blondine was thrown over the grating
which bounded the forest. She stated that Gourmandinet
had become insane from terror and grief and she had sent him
home to his parents. The king was in wild despair at this
news. He ran to the Forest of Lilacs and he had to be withheld
by force from throwing himself across the boundary in
order to search for his cherished Blondine. They carried
him to the palace where he yielded to the most frightful sorrow
and despair, calling unceasingly upon his dear Blondine,
his beloved child. At last, overcome by grief, he slept
and saw in a dream Blondine in the castle of Bonne-Biche
and Beau-Minon. Bonne-Biche gave him the sweet assurance
that Blondine should one day be restored to him and
that her childhood should be calm and happy.</p>

<p>The mirror now became misty and everything disappeared,
then again clear as crystal and Blondine saw her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
father a second time. He had become old, his hair was
white as snow and his countenance was sad. He held in his
hand a little portrait of Blondine, his tears fell upon it and
he pressed it often to his lips. The king was alone. Blondine
saw neither the Queen nor Brunette.</p>

<p>Poor Blondine wept bitterly.</p>

<p>"Alas!" said she, "why is my dear father alone?
Where is the queen? Where is Brunette?"</p>

<p>"The queen," said Bonne-Biche, "showed so little grief
at your death, my princess, that your father's heart was filled
with hatred and suspicion towards her and he sent her back
to the king Turbulent, her father, who confined her in a
tower, where she soon died of rage and anger. All the
world supposed you to be dead. As to your sister Brunette,
she became so wicked, so insupportable, that the king hastened
to give her in marriage last year to the prince Violent,
who charged himself with the duty of reforming the character
of the cruel and envious princess Brunette. The prince
was stern and harsh. Brunette saw that her wicked heart
prevented her from being happy and she commenced trying
to correct her faults. You will see her again some day, dear
Blondine and your example may complete her reformation."</p>

<p>Blondine thanked Bonne-Biche tenderly for all these details.
Her heart prompted her to ask, "But when shall I see
my father and sister?" But she feared to appear ungrateful
and too anxious to leave the castle of her good friends. She<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
resolved then to await another more suitable opportunity
to ask this question.</p>

<p>The days passed away quietly and pleasantly. Blondine
was much occupied, but was sometimes melancholy.
She had no one to talk with but Bonne-Biche and she was
only with her during the hours of lessons and repasts. Beau-Minon
could not converse and could only make himself understood
by signs. The gazelles served Blondine with zeal
and intelligence but they had not the gift of speech.</p>

<p>Blondine walked every day, always accompanied by
Beau-Minon, who pointed out to her the most lovely and sequestered
paths and the rarest and richest flowers.</p>

<p>Bonne-Biche had made Blondine promise solemnly
never to leave the enclosure of the park and never to enter
the forest. Many times Blondine had asked Bonne-Biche
the reason of this prohibition. Sighing profoundly, she
had replied:</p>

<p>"Ah, Blondine! do not seek to penetrate the forest. It is
a fatal spot. May you never enter there."</p>

<p>Sometimes Blondine mounted a pavilion which was
built on an eminence near the boundary of the forest. She
looked admiringly and longingly at the magnificent trees,
the lovely and fragrant flowers, the thousand graceful birds
flying and singing and seeming to call her name.</p>

<p>"Alas!" said she, "why will not Bonne-Biche allow me
to walk in this beautiful forest? What possible danger can<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
I encounter in that lovely place and under her protection?"</p>

<p>Whenever she was lost in these reflections, Beau-Minon,
who seemed to comprehend what was passing in her heart,
mewed plaintively, pulled her robe and tried to draw her
from the pavilion.</p>

<p>Blondine smiled sweetly, followed her gentle companion
and recommenced her walk in the solitary park.</p>

<h3 class="chapter2"><a name="THE_PARROT" id="THE_PARROT"></a>THE PARROT</h3>


<p><span class="dropcap">S</span><span class="upper">ix</span> months had passed since Blondine awaked from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
her seven years' sleep. It seemed to the little princess
a long time. The remembrance of her dear father
often saddened her heart.</p>

<p>Bonne-Biche and Beau-Minon seemed to divine her
thoughts. Beau-Minon mewed plaintively, and Bonne-Biche
heaved the most profound sighs. Blondine spoke but
rarely of that which occupied her thoughts continually.
She feared to offend Bonne-Biche, who had said to her three
or four times:</p>

<p>"Dear Blondine, be patient. You will see your father
when you are fifteen, if you continue wise and good. Trust
me, dear child; do not trouble yourself about the future and
above all do not seek to leave us."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span></p>

<p>One morning Blondine was alone and very sad. She
was musing upon her singular and monotonous existence.
Suddenly she was disturbed in her reverie by three soft little
strokes upon her window. Raising her head, she perceived
a parrot with beautiful green plumage and throat and breast
of bright orange.</p>

<p>Surprised at the appearance of a bird entirely unknown
to her, she opened the window and invited the parrot to enter.</p>

<p>What was her amazement when the bird said to her, in a
fine sharp voice:</p>

<p>"Good day, Blondine! I know that you sometimes
have a very tedious time of it, because you have no one to talk
to. I have taken pity upon you and come to have a chat with
you. But I pray you do not mention that you have seen me,
for Bonne-Biche would cut my throat if she knew it."</p>

<p>"Why so, beautiful Parrot? Bonne-Biche is good; she
injures no one and only hates the wicked."</p>

<p>"Blondine, listen! If you do not promise to conceal
my visit from Bonne-Biche and Beau-Minon, I will fly away
at once and never return."</p>

<p>"Since you wish it so much, beautiful Parrot, I will
promise silence. Let us chat a little. It is a long time since
I have had an opportunity to converse. You seem to me
gay and witty. I do not doubt that you will amuse me
much."</p>

<p>Blondine listened with delight to the lively talk of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
Parrot, who complimented extravagantly her beauty, her wit
and her talents.</p>

<p>Blondine was enchanted. In about an hour the Parrot
flew away, promising to return the next day. In short, he
returned every day and continued to compliment and amuse
her.</p>

<p>One morning he struck upon the window and said:</p>

<p>"Blondine! Blondine! open the window, quickly! I
bring you news of your father. But above all make no noise
unless you want my throat cut."</p>

<p>Blondine was overwhelmed with joy. She opened the
window with alacrity and said: "Is it true, my beautiful Parrot,
that you bring me news of my dear father? Speak
quickly! What is he doing and how is he?"</p>

<p>"Your father is well, Blondine, but he weeps your loss
always. I have promised him to employ all my power to deliver
you from your prison but I can do nothing without your
assistance."</p>

<p>"My prison!" said Blondine. "But you are ignorant of
all the goodness which Bonne-Biche and Beau-Minon have
shown me, of the pains they have lavished upon my education,
of all their tenderness and forbearance. They will be
enchanted to find a way of restoring me to my father. Come
with me, beautiful Parrot and I will present you to Bonne-Biche.
Come, I entreat you."</p>

<p>"Ah! Blondine," said the sharp voice of the Parrot, "it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
is you, Princess, who do not know Bonne-Biche and Beau-Minon.
They detest me because I have sometimes succeeded
in rescuing their victims from them. You will never
see your father again, Blondine, you will never leave this
forest, unless you yourself shall break the charm which holds
you here."</p>

<p>"What charm?" said Blondine. "I know of no charm
and what interest have Bonne-Biche and Beau-Minon in
keeping me a prisoner?"</p>

<p>"Is it not to their interest to enliven their solitude,
Blondine? There is a talisman which can procure your
release. It is a simple Rose, which, gathered by yourself,
will deliver you from your exile and restore you to the arms
of your fond father."</p>

<p>"But there is not a single Rose in the garden. How
then can I gather one?"</p>

<p>"I will explain this to you another day, Blondine. Now
I can tell you no more, as I hear Bonne-Biche coming. But
to convince you of the virtues of the Rose, entreat Bonne-Biche
to give you one and see what she will say. To-morrow&mdash;to-morrow,
Blondine!"</p>

<p>The Parrot flew away, well content to have scattered
in Blondine's heart the first seeds of discontent and ingratitude.</p>

<p>The Parrot had scarcely disappeared when Bonne-Biche
entered. She appeared greatly agitated.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span></p>

<p>"With whom have you been talking, Blondine?" looking
suspiciously towards the open window.</p>

<p>"With no one, madam," said the princess.</p>

<p>"I am certain I heard voices in conversation."</p>

<p>"I must have been speaking to myself."</p>

<p>Bonne-Biche made no reply. She was very sad and
tears fell from her eyes.</p>

<p>Blondine was also engaged in thought. The cunning
words of the Parrot made her look upon the kindness
of Bonne-Biche and Beau-Minon in a totally different
light.</p>

<p>In place of saying to herself that a hind which had the
power to speak, to make wild beasts intelligent, to put an
infant to sleep for seven years, to dedicate seven years to a
tiresome and ignorant little girl, in short, a hind lodged and
served like a queen, could be no ordinary criminal; in place
of cherishing a sentiment of gratitude for all that Bonne-Biche
had done for her, Blondine, alas! believed blindly in
the Parrot, the unknown bird of whose character and veracity
she had no proof. She did not remember that the Parrot
could have no possible motive for risking its life to render
her a service. Blondine believed it though, implicitly,
because of the flattery which the Parrot had lavished upon
her. She did not even recall with gratitude the sweet and
happy existence which Bonne-Biche and Beau-Minon had
secured to her. She resolved to follow implicitly the coun<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>sels
of the Parrot. During the course of the day she said to
Bonne-Biche:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Why, madam, do I not see among your flowers the
most lovely and charming of all flowers&mdash;the fragrant
Rose?"</p>

<p>Bonne-Biche was greatly agitated and said in a trembling
voice:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Blondine! Blondine! do not ask for this most perfidious
flower, which pierces all who touch it! Never speak to me
of the Rose, Blondine. You cannot know what fatal danger
this flower contains for you!"</p>

<p>The expression of Bonne-Biche was so stern and severe
that Blondine dared not question her further.</p>

<p>The day passed away sadly enough. Bonne-Biche was
unhappy and Beau-Minon very sad.</p>

<p>Early in the morning, Blondine ran to her window and
the Parrot entered the moment she opened it.</p>

<p>"Well, my dear Blondine, did you notice the agitation
of Bonne-Biche, when you mentioned the Rose? I promised
you to point out the means by which you could obtain
one of these charming flowers. Listen now to my counsel.
You will leave this park and enter the forest. I will accompany
you and I will conduct you to a garden where you will
find the most beautiful Rose in the world!"</p>

<p>"But how is it possible for me to leave the park? Beau-Minon
always accompanies me in my walks."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span></p>

<p>"Try to get rid of him," said the Parrot; "but if that is
impossible, go in spite of him."</p>

<p>"If this Rose is at a distance, will not my absence be
perceived?"</p>

<p>"It is about an hour's walk. Bonne-Biche has been
careful to separate you as far as possible from the Rose in
order that you might not find the means to escape from her
power."</p>

<p>"But why does she wish to hold me captive? She is
all-powerful and could surely find pleasures more acceptable
than educating an ignorant child."</p>

<p>"All this will be explained to you in the future, Blondine,
when you will be in the arms of your father. Be firm!
After breakfast, in some way get away from Beau-Minon
and enter the forest. I will expect you there."</p>

<p>Blondine promised, and closed the window, fearing that
Bonne-Biche would surprise her.</p>

<p>After breakfast, according to her usual custom, she
entered the garden. Beau-Minon followed her in spite of
some rude rebuffs which he received with plaintive mews.
Arrived at the alley which led out of the park, Blondine
resolved to get rid of Beau-Minon.</p>

<p>"I wish to be alone," said she, sternly; "begone, Beau-Minon!"</p>

<p>Beau-Minon pretended not to understand. Blondine
was impatient and enraged. She forgot herself so far as to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
strike Beau-Minon with her foot. When poor Beau-Minon
received this humiliating blow, he uttered a cry of anguish
and fled towards the palace. Blondine trembled and was on
the point of recalling him, when a false shame arrested her.
She walked on rapidly to the gate, opened it not without
trembling and entered the forest. The Parrot joined her
without delay.</p>

<p>"Courage, Blondine! in one hour you will have the
Rose and will see your father, who weeps for you."</p>

<p>At these words, Blondine recovered her resolution
which had begun to falter. She walked on in the path indicated
by the Parrot, who flew before her from branch to
branch. The forest, which had seemed so beautiful and
attractive near the park of Bonne-Biche, became wilder
and more entangled. Brambles and stones almost filled up
the path, the sweet songs of the birds were no longer heard
and the flowers had entirely disappeared. Blondine felt
oppressed by an inexplicable restlessness. The Parrot
pressed her eagerly to advance.</p>

<p>"Quick, quick, Blondine! time flies! If Bonne-Biche
perceives your absence you will never again see your father."</p>

<p>Blondine, fatigued, almost breathless, with her arms
torn by the briers and her shoes in shreds, now declared that
she would go no further when the Parrot exclaimed:&mdash;</p>

<p>"We have arrived, Blondine. Look! that is the enclosure
which separates us from the Rose."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span></p>

<p>Blondine saw at a turn in the path a small enclosure,
the gate of which was quickly opened by the Parrot. The
soil was arid and stony but a magnificent, majestic rose-bush
adorned with one Rose, which was more beautiful than all
the roses of the world grew in the midst of this sterile spot.</p>

<p>"Take it, Blondine!" said the parrot; "you deserve it&mdash;you
have truly earned it!"</p>

<p>Blondine seized the branch eagerly and in spite of the
thorns which pierced her fingers cruelly, she tore it from the
bush.</p>

<p>The Rose was scarcely grasped firmly in her hand, when
she heard a burst of mocking laughter. The Flower fell
from her grasp, crying:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Thanks, Blondine, for having delivered me from the
prison in which Bonne-Biche held me captive. I am your
evil genius! Now you belong to me!"</p>

<p>"Ha! ha!" now exclaimed the Parrot. "Thanks, Blondine!
I can now resume my form of magician. You have
destroyed your friends for I am their mortal enemy!"</p>

<p>Saying these cruel words, the Parrot and the Rose disappeared,
leaving Blondine alone in the forest.</p>

<h3 class="chapter2"><a name="REPENTANCE" id="REPENTANCE"></a>REPENTANCE</h3>


<p><span class="dropcap">B</span><span class="upper">londine</span> was stupefied! Her conduct now appeared<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
to her in all its horror. She had shown a
monstrous ingratitude towards the friends who had
been so tenderly devoted to her&mdash;who had dedicated seven
years to the care of her education. Would these kind
friends ever receive her, ever pardon her? What would be
her fate, if they should close their doors against her? And
then, what did those awful words of the wicked Parrot
signify: "You have caused the destruction of your
friends"?</p>

<p>Blondine turned round and wished to retrace her steps
to the castle of Bonne-Biche. The briers and thorns tore her
arms and face terribly. She continued however to force her
way bravely through the thickets and after three hours of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
most painful walking she came before the castle of Bonne-Biche
and Beau-Minon.</p>

<div class="minispace">&nbsp;</div>

<div class="caption"><i>Blondine sees the castle of Bonne-Biche and Beau-Minon</i></div>
<div class="minispace">&nbsp;</div>

<p>Horror seized upon her, when in place of the superb
building she saw only an appalling ruin&mdash;in place of the
magnificent trees and rare flowers which surrounded it, only
briers and thorns, nettles and thistles, could be seen.
Terrified and most desolate, she tried to force her way in the
midst of the ruins, to seek some knowledge of her kind<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
friends. A large Toad issued from a pile of stones, advanced
before her, and said:&mdash;</p>

<p>"What are you seeking? Have you not occasioned the
death of your friends by the basest ingratitude? Begone!
do not insult their memory by your unwelcome presence!"</p>

<p>"Alas! alas!" cried Blondine, "my poor friends, Bonne-Biche
and Beau-Minon, why can I not atone by my death for
the sufferings I have caused them?" And she fell, sobbing
piteously, upon the stones and nettles; her grief and her repentance
were so excessive that she did not feel their sharp
points in her tender flesh. She wept profusely a long time.
At last she arose and looked about her, hoping to find some
shelter where she might take refuge. Ruin only stared her
in the face!</p>

<p>"Well," said she, "let the wild beasts tear me to pieces,
let me die of hunger and thirst, if I can expiate my sins here
upon the tomb of Bonne-Biche and Beau-Minon!"</p>

<p>As she uttered these words, she heard a soft voice
saying: "True repentance can atone for the worst of
crimes."</p>

<p>She raised her head and saw only an immense black
Crow flying above her.</p>

<p>"Alas! alas!" said Blondine, "my repentance however
true, however bitter it may be, can never give me back the
lives of my dear Bonne-Biche and Beau-Minon!"</p>

<p>"Courage, courage, Blondine! redeem your fault by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
your repentance and do not allow yourself to be utterly cast
down by grief."</p>

<p>The poor princess arose and left the scene of desolation.
She followed a little path, where the large trees seemed to
have rooted out the brambles and the earth was covered with
moss. She was utterly exhausted with grief and fatigue and
fell at the foot of a large tree, sobbing piteously.</p>

<p>"Courage, Blondine!" said another voice; "courage and
hope!"</p>

<p>She saw near her only a Frog, which was looking at her
compassionately.</p>

<p>"Oh, Frog!" said the princess, "you seem to pity my
anguish! What will become of me now that I am alone
and desolate in the world?"</p>

<p>"Courage and hope!" was the reply.</p>

<p>Blondine sighed deeply and looked around, hoping to
discover some herb or fruit to appease her hunger and thirst.
She saw nothing and her tears flowed freely. The sound of
bells now somewhat dissipated her despairing thoughts.
She saw a beautiful cow approaching her, gently and
slowly. On arriving near her, the cow paused, bowed down,
and showed her a silver porringer attached to her neck by a
chain of beaten gold.</p>

<p>Blondine was very grateful for this unexpected succor.
She detached the porringer, milked the cow and drank the
sweet milk with delight. The pretty, gentle cow signed to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
her to replace the porringer. Blondine obeyed, kissed her
on the neck and said, sadly:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Thanks, Blanchette, it is without doubt to my poor
friends that I owe this sweet charity. Perhaps in another
and better world they can see the repentance of their poor
Blondine and wish to assist her in her frightful position."</p>

<p>"A true repentance will obtain pardon for all faults,"
said a kind voice.</p>

<p>"Ah!" exclaimed Blondine, "years of sorrow and weeping
for my crimes would not suffice! I can never pardon
myself!"</p>

<p>In the mean time, night approached. Notwithstanding
her anguish and repentance, Blondine began to reflect upon
some means of securing herself from the ferocious wild
beasts, whose terrible roars she already believed she heard in
the distance. She saw some steps before her a kind of hut,
formed by several trees growing near together and interlacing
their branches. Bowing her head, she entered, and
found that by carefully connecting some branches she could
form a pretty and secure retreat. She employed the remainder
of the day in arranging this little room and gathered a
quantity of moss, with which she made herself a bed and
pillow. She concealed the entrance to this little retreat by
some broken branches and leaves and went to rest, utterly
worn out with regret and fatigue.</p>

<p>When Blondine awoke it was broad daylight. At first<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
she could scarcely collect her thoughts and understand her
position but the sad realities of her lot were soon apparent to
her and she commenced weeping as before.</p>

<p>Blondine was hungry, and she could not imagine how she
was to secure food but soon she heard again the sound of the
cow-bells. In a few moments, Blanchette stood near her.
Blondine again loosened the porringer, drew the milk and
drank till her hunger was appeased, then replaced the porringer
and kissed Blanchette, hoping to see her again during
the day. Every day&mdash;in the morning, at midday and in the
evening&mdash;Blanchette came to offer Blondine her frugal
repast.</p>

<p>Blondine passed the time in tears for her poor friends,
and bitter self-reproach for her crimes.</p>

<p>"By my unpardonable disobedience," she said to herself,
"I have caused the most terrible misfortunes, which it is
not in my power to repair. I have not only lost my good and
true friends but I am deprived of the only means of finding
my father, my poor father, who perhaps still expects his Blondine,
his most unhappy Blondine, condemned to live and die
alone in this frightful forest where her evil genius reigns
supreme."</p>

<p>Blondine sought to amuse and employ herself in every
possible way. Her little home was neatly arranged, and
fresh moss and leaves composed her simple couch. She
had tied some branches together and formed a seat and she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
made herself some needles and pins of the thorns and twisted
some thread from the hemp which grew near her little hut,
and with these implements she had mended the rents in her
shoes.</p>

<p>In this simple way Blondine lived for six months; her
grief was always the same and it is just to say that it was not
her sad and solitary life which made her unhappy but sincere
regret for her fault. She would willingly have consented to
pass her life in the forest if she could thus have brought to
life Bonne-Biche and Beau-Minon.</p>

<h3 class="chapter2"><a name="THE_TORTOISE" id="THE_TORTOISE"></a>THE TORTOISE</h3>


<p><span class="dropcap">O</span><span class="upper">ne</span> day Blondine was seated at the entrance of her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
hut, musing sadly as usual, thinking of her lost
friends and of her father, when she saw before her
an enormous Tortoise.</p>

<p>"Blondine," said the Tortoise, "if you will place yourself
under my protection, I will conduct you out of this
forest."</p>

<p>"And why, Madam Tortoise, should I seek to leave this
forest? Here I caused the death of my friends and here I
wish to die."</p>

<p>"Are you very certain of their death, Blondine?"</p>

<p>"What do you mean? Is it possible I may be deceived?
But, no; I saw the ruins of their castle. The Parrot and the
Toad assured me of their death. You are kind and good and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
wish to console me without doubt but, alas! I do not hope to
see them again. If they still lived they would not have left
me alone with the frightful despair of having caused their
death."</p>

<p>"But how do you know, Blondine, that this seeming neglect
is not forced upon them? They may now be subjected
to a power greater than their own. You know, Blondine,
that a true repentance will obtain pardon for many crimes."</p>

<p>"Ah! Madam Tortoise, if they still live, if you can give
me news of them, if you can assure me that I need no longer
reproach myself with their death, assure me that I shall one
day see them again, there is no price which I will not gladly
pay to merit this great happiness."</p>

<p>"Blondine, I am not permitted to disclose to you the fate
of your friends but if you have the courage to mount on my
back, remain there for six months and not address a single
question to me during the journey, I will conduct you to a
place where all will be revealed."</p>

<p>"I promise all that you ask, Madam Tortoise, provided I
can only learn what has become of my friends."</p>

<p>"Take care, Blondine! reflect well. Six months without
descending from my back and without asking me a single
question! When once you have accepted the conditions,
when we have commenced our journey, if you have not the
courage to endure to the end, you will remain eternally in
the power of the enchanter, Perroquet, and his sister Rose<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
and I cannot even continue to bestow upon you the little
assistance to which you owe your life during the last six
months."</p>

<p>"Let us go, Madam Tortoise let us be off, immediately.
I prefer to die of hunger and fatigue rather than of grief and
uncertainty. Your words have brought hope to my poor
heart, and I have courage to undertake even a more difficult
journey than that of which you speak."</p>

<p>"Let it be according to your wish, Blondine. Mount
my back. Fear neither hunger nor thirst nor cold nor sunshine
nor any accident during our long journey. As long
as it lasts you shall not suffer from any inconvenience."</p>

<p>Blondine mounted on the back of the Tortoise. "Now,
silence!" said she; "and not one word till we have arrived and
I speak to you first."</p>

<h3 class="chapter2"><a name="THE_JOURNEY_AND_ARRIVAL" id="THE_JOURNEY_AND_ARRIVAL"></a>THE JOURNEY AND ARRIVAL</h3>


<p><span class="dropcap">T</span><span class="upper">he</span> journey of Blondine lasted, as the Tortoise had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
said, six months. They were three months passing
through the forest. At the end of that time she
found herself on an arid plain which it required six weeks to
cross. Then Blondine perceived a castle which reminded
her of that of Bonne-Biche and Beau-Minon. They were a
full month passing through the avenue to this castle.</p>

<p>Blondine burned with impatience. Would she indeed
learn the fate of her dear friends at the palace? In spite of
her extreme anxiety, she dared not ask a single question. If
she could have descended from the back of the Tortoise, ten
minutes would have sufficed for her to reach the castle.
But, alas! the Tortoise crept on slowly and Blondine remem<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>bered
that she had been forbidden to alight or to utter a word.
She resolved, therefore, to control her impatience. The
Tortoise seemed rather to relax than to increase her speed.
She consumed fourteen days still in passing through this
avenue. They seemed fourteen centuries to Blondine. She
never, however, lost sight of the castle or of the door. The
place seemed deserted; she heard no noise, she saw no sign
of life.</p>

<p>At last, after twenty-four days' journey, the Tortoise
paused, and said to Blondine:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Now, princess, descend. By your courage and obedience
you have earned the recompense I promised. Enter
the little door which you see before you. The first person
you will meet will be the fairy Bienveillante and she will
make known to you the fate of your friends."</p>

<p>Blondine sprang lightly to the earth. She had been
immovable so long she feared her limbs would be cramped
but on the contrary she was as light and active as when she
had lived so happily with her dear Bonne-Biche and Beau-Minon
and ran joyously and gracefully gathering flowers
and chasing butterflies.</p>

<p>After having thanked the Tortoise most warmly she
opened the door which had been pointed out to her and found
herself before a young person clothed in white, who asked in
a sweet voice, whom she desired to see?</p>

<div class="caption"><i>They were three months passing through the forest</i></div>
<div class="minispace">&nbsp;</div>


<p>"I wish to see the fairy Bienveillante. Tell her, I pray
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>you, miss, that the princess Blondine begs earnestly to see her
without delay."</p>

<p>"Follow me, princess", replied the young girl.</p>

<p>Blondine followed in great agitation. She passed
through several beautiful rooms and met many young girls
clothed in white, like her guide. They looked at her as if
they recognized her and smiled graciously.</p>

<p>At last Blondine arrived in a room in every respect
resembling that of Bonne-Biche in the Forest of Lilacs.
The remembrances which this recalled were so painful that
she did not perceive the disappearance of her fair young
guide.</p>

<p>Blondine gazed sadly at the furniture of the room. She
saw but one piece which had not adorned the apartment of
Bonne-Biche in the Forest of Lilacs. This was a wardrobe
in gold and ivory, exquisitely carved. It was closed.
Blondine felt herself drawn towards it in an inexplicable
manner. She was gazing at it intently, not having indeed
the power to turn her eyes away, when a door opened and a
young and beautiful woman, magnificently dressed, entered
and drew near Blondine.</p>

<p>"What do you wish, my child?" said she, in a sweet,
caressing voice.</p>

<p>"Oh, madam!" said Blondine, throwing herself at her
feet, "I have been assured that you could give me news of my
dear, kind friends, Bonne-Biche and Beau-Minon. You<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
know, madam, without doubt by what heedless disobedience
I gave them up to destruction and that I wept for them a long
time, believing them to be dead but the Tortoise, who conducted
me here, has given me reason to hope I may one day
see them again. Tell me, madam, tell me if they yet live and
if I may dare hope for the happiness of rejoining them?"</p>

<p>"Blondine", replied the fairy Bienveillante, sadly, "you
are now about to know the fate of your friends, but no matter
what you see or hear, do not lose courage or hope."</p>

<p>Saying these words, she seized the trembling Blondine
and conducted her in front of the wardrobe which had already
so forcibly attracted her attention.</p>

<p>"Blondine, here is the key to this wardrobe. Open it,
and be brave!"</p>

<p>She handed Blondine a gold key. With a trembling
hand the princess opened the wardrobe. What was her
anguish when she saw the skins of Bonne-Biche and Beau-Minon
fastened to the wardrobe with diamond nails! At
this terrible sight the unfortunate princess uttered a cry of
horror and fell insensible at the feet of the fairy. At this
moment the door opened and a prince, beautiful as the day,
sprang towards Blondine, saying:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Oh, my mother! this is too severe a trial for my sweet
Blondine!"</p>

<p>"Alas! my son, my heart also bleeds for her. But you
know that this last punishment was indispensable to deliver<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
her for ever from the yoke of the cruel genius of the Forest
of Lilacs."</p>

<p>The fairy Bienveillante now with her wand touched
Blondine, who was immediately restored to consciousness
but despairing and sobbing convulsively, she exclaimed:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Let me die at once! My life is odious to me! No
hope, no happiness, from this time forth for ever for poor
Blondine! My friends! my cherished friends! I will join
you soon in the land of shadows!"</p>

<p>"Blondine! ever dear Blondine!" said the fairy, clasping
her in her arms, "your friends live and love you tenderly. I
am Bonne-Biche and this is my son, Beau-Minon. The
wicked genius of the Forest of Lilacs, taking advantage of
the negligence of my son, obtained dominion over us and
forced us into the forms under which you have known us.
We could not resume our natural appearance unless you
should pluck the Rose, which I, knowing it to be your evil
genius, retained captive. I placed it as far as possible from
the castle in order to withdraw it from your view. I knew
the misfortune to which you would be exposed on delivering
your evil genius from his prison and Heaven is my witness,
that my son and I would willingly have remained a Hind and
a Cat for ever in your eyes in order to spare you the cruel
tortures to which you have been subjected. The Parrot
gained you over, in spite of all our precautions. You know
the rest, my dear child. But you can never know all that we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
have suffered in witnessing your tears and your desolation."</p>

<p>Blondine embraced the Fairy ardently and addressed a
thousand questions to her.</p>

<p>"What has become of the gazelles who waited upon us
so gracefully?"</p>

<p>"You have already seen them, dear Blondine. They
are the young girls who accompanied you. They also were
changed when the evil genius gained his power over us."</p>

<p>"And the good white cow who brought me milk every
day?"</p>

<p>"We obtained permission from the Queen of the Fairies
to send you this light refreshment. The encouraging words
of the Crow came also from us."</p>

<p>"You, then, madam, also sent me the Tortoise?"</p>

<p>"Yes, Blondine. The Queen of the Fairies, touched by
your repentance and your grief, deprived the Evil Genius
of the Forest of all power over us on condition of obtaining
from you one last proof of submission, compelling you to
take this long and fatiguing journey and inflicting the
terrible punishment of making you believe that my son and I
had died from your imprudence. I implored, entreated the
Queen of the Fairies to spare you at least this last anguish
but she was inflexible."</p>

<p>Blondine gazed at her lost friends, listened eagerly to
every word and did not cease to embrace those she had feared
were eternally separated from her by death. The remem<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>brance
of her dear father now presented itself. The prince
Parfait understood her secret desire and made it known to his
mother, the fairy Bienveillante.</p>

<p>"Prepare yourself, dear Blondine, to see your father.
Informed by me, he now expects you."</p>

<p>At this moment, Blondine found herself in a chariot of
gold and pearls, the fairy Bienveillante seated at her right
hand, and the prince Parfait at her feet, regarding her kindly
and tenderly. The chariot was drawn by four swans of dazzling
whiteness. They flew with such rapidity, that five
minutes brought them to the palace of King Benin. All the
court was assembled about the king, all were expecting the
princess Blondine.</p>

<p>When the chariot appeared, the cries of joy and welcome
were so tumultuous that the swans were confused and
almost lost their way. Prince Parfait, who guided them,
succeeded in arresting their attention and the chariot drew
up at the foot of the grand stairway. King Benin sprang
towards Blondine who, jumping lightly from the chariot,
threw herself in her father's arms. They remained a long
time in this position and everybody wept tears of joy.</p>

<p>When King Benin had somewhat recovered himself he
kissed, respectfully and tenderly, the hand of the good fairy
who, after having protected and educated the princess Blondine
had now restored her to him. He embraced the prince
Parfait whom he found most charming.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span></p>

<p>There were eight resplendent gala days in honor of the
return of Blondine. At the close of this gay festival, the
fairy Bienveillante announced her intention of returning
home. But Prince Parfait and Blondine were so melancholy
at the prospect of this separation that King Benin resolved
they should never quit the place. He wedded the
fairy and Blondine became the happy wife of Prince Parfait
who was always for her the Beau-Minon of the Forest of
Lilacs.</p>

<p>Brunette, whose character had entirely changed, came
often to see Blondine. Prince Violent, her husband, became
more amiable as Brunette became more gentle and
they were very happy.</p>

<p>As to Blondine, she had no misfortunes, no griefs. She
had lovely daughters, who resembled her, and good and
handsome sons, the image of their manly father, Prince Parfait.
Everybody loved them and every one connected with
them was happy ever after.</p>

<h2 class="chapter">GOOD LITTLE HENRY</h2>

<h3 class="chapter2"><a name="THE_POOR_SICK_MOTHER" id="THE_POOR_SICK_MOTHER"></a>THE POOR SICK MOTHER</h3>


<p><span class="dropcap">T</span><span class="upper">here</span> was a poor woman, a widow, who lived alone<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
with her little son Henry. She loved him tenderly
and she had good reason to do so, for no one had
ever seen a more charming child. Although he was but
seven years old, he kept the house while his good mother labored
diligently and then left home to sell her work and buy
food for herself and her little Henry. He swept, he washed
the floor, he cooked, he dug and cultivated the garden and
when all this was done he seated himself to mend his clothes
or his mother's shoes and to make stools and tables&mdash;in short,
to do everything his strength would enable him to do.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span></p>

<p>The house in which they lived belonged to them, but it
was very lonesome. In front of their dwelling there was a
lofty mountain so high that no one had ever ascended to its
summit, and besides it was surrounded by a rushing torrent,
by high walls and insurmountable precipices.</p>

<p>The mother and her little boy were happy but alas! one
day the poor mother fell sick. They knew no doctor and
besides they had no money to pay for one. Poor Henry
did not know how to cure her. He brought her fresh cool
water for he had nothing else to give her, he stayed by her
night and day and ate his little morsel of dry bread at the
foot of her bed. When she slept he looked at her sadly and
wept. The sickness increased from day to day and at last
the poor woman was almost in a dying condition. She
could neither speak nor swallow and she no longer knew her
little Henry, who was sobbing on his knees near her bed.
In his despair, he cried out:</p>

<p>"Fairy Bienfaisante, come to my help! Save my
mother!"</p>

<p>Henry had scarcely pronounced these words, when a
window opened and a lady richly dressed entered and in a
soft voice, said to him:</p>

<p>"What do you wish of me, my little friend? You called
me&mdash;here I am!"</p>

<p>"Madam," cried Henry, throwing himself on his knees
and clasping his hands, "if you are the fairy Bienfaisante,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
save my poor mother who is about to die and leave me alone
in the world."</p>

<p>The good fairy looked at Henry most compassionately
and then, without saying a word, she approached the poor
woman, bent over her, examined her attentively, breathed
upon her and said:</p>

<p>"It is not in my power, my poor child, to cure your
mother; her life depends upon you alone, if you have the
courage to undertake the journey I will point out to you."</p>

<p>"Speak, madam! I entreat you to speak! there is nothing
I will not undertake to save the life of my dear mother."</p>

<p>The fairy replied,</p>

<p>"You must go and seek the plant of life, which grows on
top of the mountain that you see from this window. When
you have obtained this plant, press its juice into the mouth of
your mother and she will be immediately restored to health."</p>

<p>"I will start out immediately, madam. But who will
take care of my poor mother during my absence? And,
moreover," said he, sobbing bitterly, "she will be dead before
my return."</p>

<p>"Do not worry, my dear child. If you go to seek the
plant of life, your mother will need nothing before your
return; she will remain precisely in the condition in which
you leave her. But you must dare many dangers and endure
many things before you pluck the plant of life. Great courage
and great perseverance are necessary on your part."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span></p>

<p>"I fear nothing, madam, my courage and perseverance
shall not fail. Tell me only how I shall know this plant
amongst all the others which cover the top of the mountain."</p>

<p>"When you reach the summit, call the doctor who has
charge of this plant, inform him that I have sent you and he
will give you a branch of the plant of life."</p>

<p>Henry kissed the good fairy's hands and thanked her
heartily, took a sorrowful leave of his mother, covering her
with kisses, put some bread in his pocket and set out, after
saluting the fairy respectfully.</p>

<p>The fairy smiled encouragingly at this poor child who
so bravely resolved to ascend a mountain so dangerous that
none of those who had attempted it had ever reached the
summit.</p>

<h3 class="chapter2"><a name="THE_CROW_THE_COCK_AND_THE_FROG" id="THE_CROW_THE_COCK_AND_THE_FROG"></a>THE CROW, THE COCK, AND THE FROG</h3>


<p><span class="dropcap">L</span><span class="upper">ittle</span> Henry marched resolutely to the mountain<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
which he found much more distant than it had
appeared to him. Instead of arriving in a half
hour as he had expected, he walked rapidly the whole day
without reaching its base.</p>

<p>About one-third of the way he saw a Crow which was
caught by the claw in a snare which some wicked boy had
set for him. The poor Crow sought in vain to release himself
from this trap which caused him cruel sufferings.
Henry ran to him, cut the cord which bound him and set
him at liberty. The poor Crow flew off rapidly, after having
said to Henry,</p>

<p>"Thanks, my brave Henry, I will see you again."</p>

<p>Henry was much surprised to hear the Crow speak but
he did not relax his speed.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span></p>

<p>Some time afterwards while he was resting in a grove
and eating a morsel of bread, he saw a Cock followed by a
fox and about to be taken by him in spite of his efforts to
escape. The poor frightened Cock passed very near to
Henry, who seized it adroitly, and hid it under his coat without
the fox having seen him. The fox continued his pursuit,
supposing that the Cock was before him. Henry did
not move till he was entirely out of sight. He then released
the Cock, who said to him in a low voice:</p>

<p>"Many thanks, my brave Henry, I will see you again."</p>

<p>Henry was now rested. He rose and continued his
journey. When he had advanced a considerable distance
he saw a poor Frog about to be devoured by a serpent. The
Frog trembled and, paralyzed by fear, could not move. The
serpent advanced rapidly, its horrid mouth open. Henry
seized a large stone and threw it so adroitly that it entered the
serpent's throat the moment it was about to devour the Frog.
The frightened Frog leaped to a distance and cried out,</p>

<p>"Many thanks, brave Henry; we will meet again."</p>

<p>Henry, who had before heard the Crow and the Cock
speak, was not now astonished at these words of the Frog and
continued to walk on rapidly.</p>

<p>A short time after he arrived at the foot of the mountain
but he was greatly distressed to see that a large and deep river
ran at its foot, so wide that the other side could scarcely be
seen. Greatly at a loss he paused to reflect.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span></p>

<div class="minispace">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="image border3" style="width: 538px; height: 452px;">
<a name="i075" id="i075"></a><img src="images/i075.jpg" width="538" height="452" alt="A large and deep river ran at the foot of the mountain" title="" /></div>
<div class="caption"><i>A large and deep river ran at the foot of the mountain</i></div>
<div class="minispace">&nbsp;</div>

<p>"Perhaps," said he, hopefully, "I may find a bridge, or
ford, or a boat."</p>

<p>Henry followed the course of the river which flowed
entirely around the mountain but everywhere it was equally
wide and deep and he saw neither bridge nor boat. Poor
Henry seated himself on the bank of the river, weeping bitterly.</p>

<p>"Fairy Bienfaisante! Fairy Bienfaisante! come to my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
help," he exclaimed. "Of what use will it be to me to know
that there is a plant at the top of the mountain which will
save the life of my poor mother, if I can never reach its summit?"</p>

<p>At this moment the Cock whom he had protected from
the fox appeared on the borders of the river, and said to him:</p>

<p>"The fairy Bienfaisante can do nothing for you. This
mountain is beyond her control. But you have saved my
life and I wish to prove my gratitude. Mount my back,
Henry, and by the faith of a Cock I will take you safe to the
other side."</p>

<p>Henry did not hesitate. He sprang on the Cock's back,
fully expecting to fall into the water but his clothes were not
even moist. The Cock received him so adroitly on his back
that he felt as secure as if he had been on horseback. He
held on firmly to the crest of the Cock who now commenced
the passage.</p>

<p>The river was so wide that he was flying constantly
twenty-one days before he reached the other shore; but during
these twenty-one days Henry was not sleepy and felt
neither hunger nor thirst.</p>

<p>When they arrived, Henry thanked the Cock most politely,
who graciously bristled his feathers and disappeared.
A moment after this Henry turned and to his astonishment
the river was no longer to be seen.</p>

<p>"It was without doubt the genius of the mountain who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
wished to prevent my approach," said Henry. "But, with
the help of the good fairy Bienfaisante, I think I shall yet succeed
in my mission."</p>

<h3 class="chapter2"><a name="THE_HARVEST" id="THE_HARVEST"></a>THE HARVEST</h3>


<p><span class="dropcap">H</span><span class="upper">enry</span> walked a long, long time but he walked in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
vain for he saw that he was no farther from the
foot of the mountain and no nearer to the summit
than he had been when he crossed the river. Any other
child would have retraced his steps but the brave little Henry
would not allow himself to be discouraged. Notwithstanding
his extreme fatigue he walked on twenty-one days without
seeming to make any advance. At the end of this time
he was no more discouraged than at the close of the first day.</p>

<p>"If I am obliged to walk a hundred years," he said aloud,
"I will go on till I reach the summit."</p>

<p>"You have then a great desire to arrive there, little boy?"
said an old man, looking at him maliciously and standing
just in his path. "What are you seeking at the top of this
mountain?"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span></p>

<p>"The plant of life, my good sir, to save the life of my
dear mother who is about to die."</p>

<p>The little old man shook his head, rested his little
pointed chin on the top of his gold-headed cane and after
having a long time regarded Henry, he said:</p>

<p>"Your sweet and fresh face pleases me, my boy. I am
one of the genii of this mountain. I will allow you to advance
on condition that you will gather all my wheat, that
you will beat it out, make it into flour and then into bread.
When you have gathered, beaten, ground and cooked it, then
call me. You will find all the necessary implements in the
ditch near you. The fields of wheat are before you and
cover the mountain."</p>

<p>The old man disappeared and Henry gazed in terror at
the immense fields of wheat which were spread out before
him. But he soon mastered this feeling of discouragement&mdash;took
off his vest, seized a scythe and commenced cutting
the wheat diligently. This occupied him a hundred and
ninety-five days and nights.</p>

<p>When the wheat was all cut, Henry commenced to beat
it with a flail which he found at hand. This occupied him
sixty days.</p>

<p>When the grain was all beaten out he began to grind it
in a mill which rose up suddenly near him. This occupied
him seventy days.</p>

<p>When the wheat was all ground he began to knead it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
and to cook it. He kneaded and cooked for a hundred and
twenty days.</p>

<p>As the bread was cooked he arranged it properly on
shelves, like books in a library.</p>

<p>When all was finished Henry was transported with joy
and called the genius of the mountain who appeared immediately
and counted four hundred and sixty-eight thousand
three hundred and twenty-nine new loaves of bread. He bit
and ate a little end off of two or three, drew near to Henry,
tapped him on the cheek and said:</p>

<p>"You are a good boy and I wish to pay you for your
work."</p>

<p>He drew from his pocket a little wooden box which he
gave to Henry and said, maliciously:</p>

<p>"When you return home, open this box and you will find
in it the most delicious tobacco you have ever seen."</p>

<p>Now Henry had never used tobacco and the present of
the little genius seemed to him very useless but he was too
polite to let this be seen and he thanked the old man as if
satisfied.</p>

<p>The old one smiled, then burst out laughing and disappeared.</p>

<p><span class="dropcap">H</span><span class="upper">enry</span> began to walk rapidly and perceived with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
great delight that every step brought him nearer
to the summit of the mountain. In three hours
he had walked two-thirds of the way. But suddenly he
found himself arrested by a very high wall which he had not
perceived before. He walked around it, and found, after
three days' diligent advance, that this wall surrounded the
entire mountain and that there was no door, not the smallest
opening by which he could enter.</p>

<p>Henry seated himself on the ground, to reflect upon his
situation. He resolved to wait patiently&mdash;he sat there forty-five
days. At the end of this time he said:</p>

<p>"I will not go back if I have to wait here a hundred
years."</p>

<p>He had scarcely uttered these words when a part of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
wall crumbled away with a terrible noise and he saw in the
opening a giant, brandishing an enormous cudgel.</p>

<p>"You have then a great desire to pass here, my boy?
What are you seeking beyond my wall?"</p>

<p>"I am seeking the plant of life, Master Giant, to cure
my poor mother who is dying. If it is in your power and
you will allow me to pass this wall, I will do anything for you
that you may command."</p>

<p>"Is it so? Well, listen! Your countenance pleases
me. I am one of the genii of this mountain. I will allow
you to pass this wall if you will fill my wine-cellar. Here
are all my vines. Gather the grapes, crush them, put the
juice in the casks and arrange them well in my wine-cellar.
You will find all the implements necessary at the foot of this
wall. When it is done, call me."</p>

<p>The Giant disappeared, closing the wall behind him.
Henry looked around him and as far as he could see, the
vines of the Giant were growing luxuriously.</p>

<p>"Well, well," said Henry to himself, "I cut all the wheat
of the little old man&mdash;I can surely also gather the grapes of
the big Giant. It will not take me so long and it will not be
as difficult to make wine of these grapes as to make bread
of the wheat."</p>

<div class="caption"><i>A part of the wall crumbled with a terrible noise</i></div>
<div class="minispace">&nbsp;</div>

<p>Henry took off his coat, picked up a pruning-knife
which he saw at his feet and began to cut the grapes and
throw them into the vats. It took him thirty days to gather
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>this crop. When all was finished, he crushed the grapes,
poured the juice into the casks and ranged them in the cellar,
which they completely filled. He was ninety days making
the wine.</p>

<p>When the wine was ready and everything in the cellar
in complete order, Henry called the Giant who immediately
appeared, examined the casks, tasted the wine, then turned
towards Henry and said:</p>

<p>"You are a brave little man and I wish to pay you for
your trouble. It shall not be said that you worked gratis for
the Giant of the mountain."</p>

<p>He drew a thistle from his pocket, gave it to Henry and
said:</p>

<p>"After your return home, whenever you desire anything,
smell this thistle."</p>

<p>Henry did not think the Giant very generous but he received
the thistle with an amiable smile.</p>

<p>Then the Giant whistled so loudly that the mountain
trembled and the wall and Giant disappeared entirely and
Henry was enabled to continue his journey.</p>

<h3 class="chapter2"><a name="THE_CHASE" id="THE_CHASE"></a>THE CHASE</h3>


<p><span class="dropcap">H</span><span class="upper">enry</span> was within a half-hour's walk of the summit<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
of the mountain when he reached a pit so wide
that he could not possibly jump to the other side
and so deep that it seemed bottomless. Henry did not lose
courage, however. He followed the borders of the pit till
he found himself where he started from and knew that this
yawning pit surrounded the mountain.</p>

<p>"Alas! what shall I do?" said poor Henry; "I scarcely
overcome one obstacle when another more difficult seems to
rise up before me. How shall I ever pass this pit?"</p>

<p>The poor child felt for the first time that his eyes were
filled with tears. He looked around for some means of passing
over but saw no possible chance and seated himself sadly
on the brink of the precipice. Suddenly he heard a terrible
growl. He turned and saw within ten steps of him an enormous
Wolf gazing at him with flaming eyes.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span></p>

<p>"What are you seeking in my kingdom?" said the Wolf,
in a threatening voice.</p>

<p>"Master Wolf, I am seeking the plant of life which
alone can save my dear mother who is about to die. If you
will assist me to cross this pit, I will be your devoted servant
and will obey any command you may give me."</p>

<p>"Well, my boy, if you will catch all the game which is in
my forests, birds and beasts, and make them up into pies and
nice roasts, by the faith of the genius of the mountain, I will
pass you over to the other side. You will find near this tree
all the instruments necessary to catch the game and to cook
it. When your work is done, call me."</p>

<p>Saying these words, he disappeared.</p>

<p>Henry took courage. He lifted a bow and arrow
which he saw on the ground, and began to shoot at the partridges,
woodcocks, pheasants and game of all kinds which
abounded there. But, alas! he did not understand it and
killed nothing.</p>

<p>During eight days he was shooting right and left in vain
and was at last wearied and despairing, when he saw near
him the Crow whose life he had saved in the commencement
of his journey.</p>

<p>"You rescued me from mortal danger," said the Crow,
"and I told you I should see you again. I have come to redeem
my promise. If you do not fulfil your promise to the
Wolf, he will change you into some terrible wild beast. Fol<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>low
me. I am going a-hunting and you have only to gather
the game and cook it."</p>

<p>Saying these words, the Crow flew above the trees of the
forest and with his beak and his claws killed all the game to
be found. In fact, during one hundred and fifty days he
caught one million eight hundred and sixty thousand seven
hundred and twenty-six animals and birds, squirrels, moor-cocks,
pheasants, and quails. As the Crow killed them,
Henry plucked the feathers, skinned them, cut them up and
cooked them in roasts or pies. When all was cooked he arranged
them neatly and then the Crow said to him:</p>

<p>"Adieu, Henry. There remains one obstacle yet to
overcome but in that difficulty I cannot aid you. But do not
be discouraged. The good fairies protect filial love."</p>

<p>Before Henry had time to thank the Crow, he had disappeared.
He then called the Wolf and said to him:</p>

<p>"Master Wolf, here is all the game of your forest. I
have prepared it as you ordered and now will you assist me to
pass this precipice?"</p>

<p>The Wolf examined a pheasant, crunched a roast squirrel
and a pie, licked his lips and said to Henry:</p>

<p>"You are a brave and good boy. I will pay you for
your trouble. It shall not be said that you have worked for
the Wolf of the mountain without receiving your reward."</p>

<p>Saying these words, he gave Henry a staff which he cut
in the forest and said to him:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span></p>

<div class="minispace">&nbsp;</div>

<p>"When you have gathered the plant of life and wish
yourself transported to any part of the world, mount the stick
and it will be your horse."</p>

<p>Henry was on the point of throwing this useless stick
into the woods but he wished to be polite, and receiving it
smilingly, he thanked the Wolf cordially.</p>

<p>"Get on my back, Henry," said the Wolf.</p>

<p>Henry sprang upon the Wolf's back and he made a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
bound so prodigious that they landed immediately on the
other side of the precipice.</p>

<p>Henry dismounted, thanked the Wolf and walked on
vigorously.</p>

<h3 class="chapter2"><a name="THE_FISHING" id="THE_FISHING"></a>THE FISHING</h3>


<p><span class="dropcap">A</span><span class="upper">t</span> last, after so many labors and perils, Henry saw<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
the lattice of the garden in which the plant of life
was growing and his heart bounded for joy. He
looked always upward as he walked, and went on as rapidly
as his strength would permit, when suddenly he fell into a
hole. He sprang backwards, looked anxiously around him
and saw a ditch full of water, large and long, so long indeed
that he could not see either end.</p>

<p>"Without doubt this is that last obstacle of which the
Crow spoke to me," said Henry to himself. "Since I have
overcome all my other difficulties with the help of the good
fairy Bienfaisante, she will assist me to surmount this also.
It was surely she who sent me the Cock, the Crow and the
Old Man, the Giant and the Wolf. I will wait patiently till
it shall please her to assist me this time."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span></p>

<p>On saying these words, Henry began to walk along the
ditch, hoping to find the end. He walked on steadily two
days and found himself at the end of that time just where he
had started. Henry would not give way to distress, he would
not be discouraged; he seated himself on the borders of the
ditch and said:</p>

<p>"I will not move from this spot till the genius of the
mountain allows me to pass this ditch."</p>

<p>Henry had just uttered these words when an enormous
Cat appeared before him and began to mew so horribly that
he was almost deafened by the sound. The Cat said to him:</p>

<p>"What are you doing here? Do you not know that I
could tear you to pieces with one stroke of my claws?"</p>

<p>"I do not doubt your power, Mr. Cat, but you will not
do so when you know that I am seeking the plant of life to
save my poor mother who is dying. If you will permit me
to pass your ditch, I will do anything in my power to please
you."</p>

<p>"Will you?" said the Cat. "Well, then, listen; your
countenance pleases me. If, therefore, you will catch all the
fish in this ditch and salt and cook them, I will pass you over
to the other side, on the faith of a Cat!"</p>

<p>Henry advanced some steps and saw lines, fish-hooks,
bait, and nets on the ground. He took a net, and hoped that
by one vigorous haul he would take many fish and that he
would succeed much better than with a line and hook. He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
threw the net and drew it in with great caution. But alas!
he had caught nothing!</p>

<p>Disappointed, Henry thought he had not been adroit.
He threw the net again and drew it very softly: still nothing!</p>

<p>Henry was patient. For ten days he tried faithfully
without having caught a single fish. Then he gave up the
net and tried the hook and line. He waited an hour, two
hours;&mdash;not a single fish bit at the bait! He moved from
place to place, till he had gone entirely around the ditch.
He tried diligently fifteen days and caught not a single fish.
He knew not now what to do. He thought of the good
fairy Bienfaisante, who had abandoned him at the end of his
undertaking. He seated himself sadly and gazed intently at
the ditch when suddenly the water began to boil and he saw
the head of a Frog appear.</p>

<p>"Henry," said the Frog, "you saved my life&mdash;I wish now
to save yours in return. If you do not execute the orders of
the Cat of the mountain he will eat you for his breakfast.
You cannot catch the fish because the water is so deep and
they take refuge at the bottom. But allow me to act for you.
Light your fire for cooking and prepare your vessels for salting.
I will bring you the fish."</p>

<p>Saying these words, the Frog plunged back into the
water. Henry saw that the waves were agitated and boiling
up, as if a grand contest was going on at the bottom of
the ditch. In a moment, however, the Frog reappeared,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
sprang ashore and deposited a superb salmon which he had
caught. Henry had scarcely time to seize the salmon when
the Frog leaped ashore with a carp. During sixty days the
Frog continued his labors. Henry cooked the large fish
and threw the little ones into the casks to be salted. Finally,
at the end of two months, the Frog leaped towards Henry
and said:</p>

<p>"There is not now a single fish in the ditch. You can
call the Cat of the mountain."</p>

<p>Henry thanked the Frog heartily, who extended his wet
foot towards him, in sign of friendship. Henry pressed it
affectionately and gratefully and the Frog disappeared.</p>

<p>It took Henry fifteen days to arrange properly all the
large fish he had cooked and all the casks of small fish he
had salted. He then called the Cat, who appeared immediately.</p>

<p>"Mr. Cat," said Henry, "here are all your fish cooked
and salted. Will you now keep your promise and pass me
over to the other side?"</p>

<p>The Cat examined the fish and the casks; tasted a salted
and a cooked fish, licked his lips, smiled and said to Henry:</p>

<p>"You are a brave boy! I will recompense your fortitude
and patience. It shall never be said that the Cat of the
mountain does not pay his servants."</p>

<p>Saying these words, the Cat tore off one of his own claws
and said, handing it to Henry:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span></p>

<p>"When you are sick or feel yourself growing old, touch
your forehead with this claw. Sickness, suffering and old
age will disappear. This miraculous claw will have the
same virtue for all that you love and all who love you."</p>

<p>Henry thanked the Cat most warmly, took the precious
claw and wished to try its powers immediately, as he felt painfully
weary. The claw had scarcely touched his brow when
he felt as fresh and vigorous as if he had just left his bed.</p>

<p>The Cat looked on smiling, and said: "Now get on my
tail."</p>

<p>Henry obeyed. He was no sooner seated on the Cat's
tail than he saw the tail lengthen itself till it reached across
the ditch.</p>

<h3 class="chapter2"><a name="THE_PLANT_OF_LIFE" id="THE_PLANT_OF_LIFE"></a>THE PLANT OF LIFE</h3>


<p><span class="dropcap">W</span><span class="upper">hen</span> he had saluted the Cat respectfully,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
Henry ran towards the garden of the plant of
life, which was only a hundred steps from him.
He trembled lest some new obstacle should retard him but he
reached the garden lattice without any difficulty. He
sought the gate and found it readily, as the garden was not
large. But, alas! the garden was filled with innumerable
plants utterly unknown to him and it was impossible
to know how to distinguish the plant of life. Happily he
remembered that the good fairy Bienfaisante had told him
that when he reached the summit of the mountain he must
call the Doctor who cultivated the garden of the fairies. He
called him then with a loud voice. In a moment he heard
a noise among the plants near him and saw issue from them
a little man, no taller than a hearth brush. He had a book
under his arm, spectacles on his crooked little nose and wore
the great black cloak of a doctor.</p>

<div class="minispace">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="image border3" style="width: 496px; height: 672px;">
<a name="i094" id="i094"></a><img src="images/i094.jpg" width="496" height="672" alt="&quot;What are you seeking little one?&quot;" title="" /></div>
<div class="caption"><i>&quot;What are you seeking little one?&quot;</i></div>
<div class="minispace">&nbsp;</div>

<p>"What are you seeking, little one?" said the Doctor;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
"and how is it possible that you have gained this summit?"</p>

<p>"Doctor, I come from the fairy Bienfaisante, to ask the
plant of life to cure my poor sick mother, who is about to
die."</p>

<p>"All those who come from the fairy Bienfaisante," said
the little Doctor, raising his hat respectfully, "are most welcome.
Come, my boy, I will give you the plant you seek."</p>

<p>The Doctor then buried himself in the botanical garden
where Henry had some trouble in following him, as he was
so small as to disappear entirely among the plants. At last
they arrived near a bush growing by itself. The Doctor
drew a little pruning-knife from his pocket, cut a bunch and
gave it to Henry, saying:</p>

<p>"Take this and use it as the good fairy Bienfaisante directed
but do not allow it to leave your hands. If you lay it
down under any circumstances it will escape from you and
you will never recover it."</p>

<p>Henry was about to thank him but the little man had disappeared
in the midst of his medicinal herbs, and he found
himself alone.</p>

<p>"What shall I do now in order to arrive quickly at
home? If I encounter on my return the same obstacles
which met me as I came up the mountain, I shall perhaps lose
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>my plant, my dear plant, which should restore my dear
mother to life."</p>

<p>Happily Henry now remembered the stick which the
Wolf had given him.</p>

<p>"Well, let us see," said he, "if this stick has really the
power to carry me home."</p>

<p>Saying this, he mounted the stick and wished himself at
home. In the same moment he felt himself raised in the air,
through which he passed with the rapidity of lightning and
found himself almost instantly by his mother's bed.</p>

<p>Henry sprang to his mother and embraced her tenderly.
But she neither saw nor heard him. He lost no time, but
pressed the plant of life upon her lips. At the same moment
she opened her eyes, threw her arms around Henry's neck
and exclaimed:</p>

<p>"My child! my dear Henry! I have been very sick but
now I feel almost well. I am hungry."</p>

<p>Then, looking at him in amazement, she said: "How
you have grown, my darling! How is this? How can you
have changed so in a few days?"</p>

<p>Henry had indeed grown a head taller. Two years,
seven months and six days had passed away since he left his
home. He was now nearly ten years old. Before he had
time to answer, the window opened and the good fairy Bienfaisante
appeared. She embraced Henry and, approaching
the couch of his mother, related to her all that little Henry<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
had done and suffered, the dangers he had dared, the fatigues
he endured; the courage, the patience, the goodness he had
manifested. Henry blushed on hearing himself thus praised
by the fairy. His mother pressed him to her heart, and covered
him with kisses. After the first moments of happiness
and emotion had passed away, the fairy said:</p>

<p>"Now, Henry, you can make use of the present of the
little Old Man and the Giant of the mountain."</p>

<p>Henry drew out his little box and opened it. Immediately
there issued from it a crowd of little workmen, not
larger than bees, who filled the room. They began to work
with such promptitude that in a quarter of an hour they had
built and furnished a beautiful house in the midst of a lovely
garden with a thick wood on one side and a beautiful
meadow on the other.</p>

<p>"All this is yours, my brave Henry," said the fairy.
"The Giant's thistle will obtain for you all that is necessary.
The Wolf's staff will transport you where you wish. The
Cat's claw will preserve your health and your youth and also
that of your dear mother. Adieu, Henry! Be happy and
never forget that virtue and filial love are always recompensed."</p>

<p>Henry threw himself on his knees before the fairy who
gave him her hand to kiss, smiled upon him and disappeared.</p>

<p>Henry's mother had a great desire to arise from her bed
and admire her new house, her garden, her woods and her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
meadow. But, alas! she had no dress. During her first
illness she had made Henry sell all that she possessed, as they
were suffering for bread.</p>

<p>"Alas! alas! my child, I cannot leave my bed. I have
neither dresses nor shoes."</p>

<p>"You shall have all those things, dear mother," exclaimed
Henry.</p>

<p>Drawing his thistle from his pocket, he smelled it while
he wished for dresses, linen, shoes for his mother and himself
and also for linen for the house. At the same moment the
presses were filled with linen, his mother was dressed in a
good and beautiful robe of merino and Henry completely
clothed in blue cloth, with good, substantial shoes. They
both uttered a cry of joy. His mother sprang from her bed
to run through the house with Henry. Nothing was wanting.
Everywhere the furniture was good and comfortable.
The kitchen was filled with pots and kettles; but there was
nothing in them.</p>

<p>Henry again put his thistle to his nose and desired to
have a good dinner served up.</p>

<p>A table soon appeared, with good smoking soup, a
splendid leg of lamb, a roasted pullet and good salad. They
took seats at the table with the appetite of those who had
not eaten for three years. The soup was soon swallowed,
the leg of lamb entirely eaten, then the pullet, then the salad.</p>

<p>When their hunger was thus appeased, the mother,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
aided by Henry, took off the cloth, washed and arranged all
the dishes and then put the kitchen in perfect order. They
then made up their beds with the sheets they found in the
presses and went happily to bed, thanking God and the good
fairy Bienfaisante. The mother also gave grateful thanks
for her dear son Henry.</p>

<p>They lived thus most happily, they wanted nothing&mdash;the
thistle provided everything. They did not grow old or sick&mdash;the
claw cured every ill. They never used the staff, as they
were too happy at home ever to desire to leave it.</p>

<p>Henry asked of his thistle only two cows, two good
horses and the necessaries of life for every day. He wished
for nothing superfluous, either in clothing or food and thus
he preserved his thistle as long as he lived. It is not known
when they died. It is supposed that the Queen of the Fairies
made them immortal and transported them to her palace,
where they still are.</p>

<h2 class="chapter">HISTORY OF PRINCESS ROSETTE</h2>

<h3 class="chapter2"><a name="THE_FARM" id="THE_FARM"></a>THE FARM</h3>


<p><span class="dropcap">T</span><span class="upper">here</span> was once a king and queen, who had three<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
daughters. The two eldest were twins&mdash;Orangine
and Roussette&mdash;and their parents loved them very
dearly. They were beautiful and intelligent, but they were
not very good. In this they resembled the king and queen.
The third princess was called Rosette and was three years
younger than her sisters. She was as amiable as she was
handsome, as good as she was beautiful.</p>

<p>The fairy Puissante was Rosette's godmother and this
made her two sisters, Orangine and Roussette, very jealous.
They were angry because they also had not a fairy for their
godmother.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span></p>

<p>Some days after the birth of Rosette, the king and queen
sent her to the country, on a farm, to be nursed. Rosette
lived happily here for fifteen years without her parents coming
once to see her. Every year they sent a small sum of
money to the farmer to pay Rosette's expenses and asked
some questions as to her health, but they never came to see
her nor disturbed themselves about her education.</p>

<p>Rosette would indeed have been very rude and ignorant
if her good godmother, the fairy Puissante, had not sent her
teachers and all that was necessary. In this way Rosette
learned to read, to write, to keep accounts and to work beautifully.
She became an accomplished musician, she knew
how to draw and spoke several languages.</p>

<p>Rosette was the most beautiful, the most attractive, the
most amiable and the most excellent princess in the whole
world. She had never disobeyed her nurse or godmother,
and had therefore never been reproved. She did not regret
her father and mother, as she did not know them and she did
not desire any other home than the farm where she had been
so happy.</p>

<p>One day when Rosette was seated on a bench before the
door, she saw a man arrive in a laced hat and coat; he approached
her and asked if he could speak to the princess
Rosette.</p>

<p>"Yes, without doubt," answered the princess; "I am the
princess Rosette."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span></p>

<p>"Then, princess," said the man, respectfully taking off
his hat, "be graciously pleased to receive this letter, which the
king your father has charged me to deliver to you."</p>

<p>Rosette took the letter, opened it, and read the following:</p>

<div class="blockquote"><p>"<span class="smcap">Rosette</span>: Your sisters are now eighteen years old and
it is time they were married. I have invited the princes and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
princesses of all the kingdoms of the earth to come and assist
at a festival which I intend to give in order to choose husbands
for Orangine and Roussette. You are now fifteen
years old and can properly appear at this festival. You may
come and pass three days with me. I will send for you in
eight days. I cannot send you any money for your toilet as
I am now at great expense for your sisters; besides, no one
will look at you. Come, therefore, in any clothes you please.</p>


<div class="sc right">"The King Your Father."</div>
</div>

<p>Rosette ran quickly to show this letter to her nurse.</p>

<p>"Are you pleased, Rosette, to go to this festival?"</p>

<p>"Yes, my good nurse, I am delighted. I will enjoy myself
and become acquainted with my father, mother and my
sisters and then I will return to you."</p>

<p>"But," said the nurse, shaking her head, "what dress will
you wear, my poor child?"</p>

<p>"My beautiful robe of white percale which I always
wear on holidays, my dear nurse."</p>

<p>"My poor little one, that robe is indeed very suitable for
the country but would appear miserably poor at a party of
kings and princes."</p>

<p>"Of what consequence is all this, nurse? My father
himself has said that no one will look at me. This thought
will make me much more at my ease. I shall see all and no
one will see me."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span></p>

<p>The nurse sighed but said nothing and began immediately
to mend, whiten and smooth Rosette's white robe.</p>

<p>The day before the king was to send for her, the nurse
called her and said:</p>

<p>"My dear child, here is your dress for the king's festival;
be very careful with it as I shall not be there to whiten and
smooth it for you."</p>

<p>"Thanks, my good nurse; be satisfied&mdash;I will take great
care."</p>

<p>The nurse now packed in a little trunk the percale robe
and white skirt, a pair of cotton stockings and black shoes
and then a little bouquet of flowers for Rosette to wear in
her hair. Just as she was about to close the trunk, the window
opened violently and the fairy Puissante entered.</p>

<p>"You are going, then, to your father's court, my dear
Rosette?" said the fairy.</p>

<p>"Yes, dear godmother, but only for three days."</p>

<p>"But what dress have you prepared for those three
days?"</p>

<p>"Look, godmother! look!" and she pointed to the trunk,
which was still open.</p>

<p>The fairy smiled, drew a small bottle from her pocket
and said: "I intend that my dear Rosette shall make a sensation
by her dress. This is unworthy of her."</p>

<p>The fairy opened the bottle, and threw some drops of the
liquid it contained upon the robe, which became a coarse In<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>dia
rubber cloth; then a drop upon the cotton stockings,
which changed into blue yarn; a third drop upon the bouquet,
which became a hen's egg; a fourth upon the shoes,
and they immediately changed into coarse felt.</p>

<p>"In this manner," said she, with a gracious air, "do I
wish my Rosette to appear. You must attire yourself in
all this and, to complete your toilette, here is a necklace of
nuts, a band for your hair of burrs, and bracelets of dried
beans." She kissed Rosette who was completely stupefied.
The fairy then disappeared and the nurse burst into tears.</p>

<p>"Alas! it was not worth my while to give myself all the
trouble of preparing this poor robe. Oh, my poor Rosette!
Do not go to this festival. Pretend you are ill, my child."</p>

<p>"No," said Rosette; "that would be to displease my godmother.
I am sure that she does what is best for me. She is
much wiser than I am. I will go and I will wear all that my
godmother has brought me." And the good and obedient
Rosette thought no more of her dress. She went to bed and
slept tranquilly.</p>

<p>She had scarce arranged her hair and dressed herself in
the morning when the chariot of the fairy came for her.
She embraced her nurse, took her little trunk and departed.</p>

<p><span class="dropcap">T</span><span class="upper">hey</span> were but two hours on the way, for the king's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
capital was only ten leagues from the farm. When
Rosette arrived, she was surprised to see that she
had to descend in a little, dirty court-yard, where a page attended
her.</p>

<p>"Come, princess, I am commissioned to conduct you to
your chamber."</p>

<p>"Can I not see the queen my mother?" asked Rosette,
timidly.</p>

<p>"In two hours, princess, when they are assembled for
dinner, you will see her. In the mean time you can dress."</p>

<p>Rosette followed the page, who led her through a long
corridor, at the end of which was a narrow staircase. She
ascended, slowly, after a long, long time arriving at another
corridor where she entered the chamber destined for her.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
The queen had lodged Rosette in one of the servants' rooms.
The little page placed Rosette's modest trunk in a corner and
said, with an air of embarrassment,</p>

<p>"Pardon me, princess, for having led you into this
chamber, so unworthy of you. The queen has disposed of
all the other apartments for her guests, the kings, queens,
princes and princesses. There was no other room vacant
and&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Well, well," said Rosette, smiling, "I shall not blame
you. Besides, I shall be very comfortable."</p>

<p>"I will come for you, princess, to lead you to the king
and queen at the proper hour."</p>

<p>"I will be ready," said Rosette, "adieu, pretty page."</p>

<p>Rosette now unpacked her trunk. Her heart was beating
and swelling tumultuously. Sighing heavily, she drew
out her robe of coarse cloth and the other articles of her toilette.
Rosette was very adroit. She arranged her exquisite
blonde hair most beautifully, with a pullet's feather and a
band made of burrs. Her head-dress was indeed so charming
that it made her a hundred times more lovely. When she
had put on her shoes and stockings and her robe, what was
her amazement to see that it was made of gold brocade, embroidered
with rubies of marvellous beauty; her coarse heavy
shoes were now white satin, adorned with buckles of one
single ruby of wonderful splendour; her stockings were of
silk and as fine as a spider's web; her necklace was of rubies<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
surrounded with large diamonds; her bracelets of diamonds,
the most splendid that had ever been seen.</p>

<p>Rosette now ran to the glass and saw that the pullet's
wing had become a magnificent locket and that the pendant
was a carbuncle of such beauty and brilliancy that a fairy
alone could possess it.</p>

<p>Rosette, happy, delighted, exultant, danced around the
little room and thanked her good godmother aloud for having
tested her obedience and thus magnificently rewarded it.</p>

<p>The page now knocked at the door, entered and started
back, dazzled by the beauty of Rosette and the magnificence
of her toilette. Rosette followed him. They descended the
stairs, passed through many apartments and at last entered a
suite of superb salons, filled with kings, queens and nobles.
Every one who saw Rosette paused and turned to admire her.
The modest princess, however, was ashamed to be thus gazed
at and did not dare raise her eyes. At last the page paused
and said to Rosette:</p>

<p>"Princess, behold the queen your mother and the king!"</p>

<p>Rosette raised her eyes and saw just before her the king
and queen who regarded her with a comic surprise.</p>

<p>"Madam," said the king at last to her, "be graciously
pleased to tell me your name. You are no doubt some great
queen or still greater fairy whose unexpected presence is an
honor and a happiness for us."</p>

<p>"Sire," said Rosette, falling gracefully upon her knees,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
"I am neither a great queen nor a powerful fairy but your
daughter Rosette, for whom you were kind enough to send."</p>

<p>"Rosette!" exclaimed the queen; "Rosette clothed more
magnificently than I have ever been! Who, then, miss, has
given you all these beautiful things?"</p>

<p>"My godmother, madam. Graciously permit me,
madam, to kiss your hand and present me to my sisters."</p>

<p>The queen gave her hand coldly. Then pointing to
Orangine and Roussette, who were by her side, she said:
"There are your sisters."</p>

<p>Poor Rosette, saddened by this cold welcome from her
father and mother, turned gladly towards her sisters and
wished to embrace them but they drew back with terror, fearing
that while embracing them Rosette would displace the
red and white with which they were painted. Orangine covered
herself with white to conceal her yellow skin and Roussette
to hide her ugly freckles.</p>

<p>Rosette was repulsed by her sisters but was soon surrounded
by the ladies of the court and all the invited princes.
As she conversed with ready grace and goodness and spoke
several languages she charmed all those who approached her.
Orangine and Roussette were frightfully jealous. The king
and queen were furious for Rosette absorbed all attention;
no one paid any attention to the sisters.</p>

<p>At table the young prince Charmant, who was monarch
of the most magnificent and beautiful of all the kingdoms of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
the earth and whom Orangine hoped to wed, placed himself
by the side of Rosette and was completely absorbed in her
during the repast.</p>

<p>After dinner, Orangine and Roussette, in order to draw
some attention towards themselves, sang a duet. They sang
indeed admirably and accompanied themselves on the harp.
Rosette who was truly good and wished her sister to love her,
applauded them rapturously and complimented them on
their talent.</p>

<p>Orangine, in place of being touched by this generous
sentiment and hoping to play her sister a malicious trick,
now insisted upon her singing. Rosette for some time modestly
refused. Her sisters, who supposed that she did not
know how to sing, were insistent. The queen herself, desiring
to humiliate poor Rosette, joined her entreaties to those
of Orangine and Roussette and in fact commanded the
young princess to sing.</p>

<p>Rosette curtsied to the queen. "I obey, madam," said
she.</p>

<p>She took the harp and the enchanting grace of her position
astonished her sisters. They would have been glad indeed
to interrupt her when she commenced her prelude for
they saw at a glance that her talent was much superior to
theirs. But when, in a beautiful and melodious voice, she
sang a romance, composed by herself on the happiness of
being good and beloved there was an outbreak of admiration,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
the enthusiasm became general and her sisters almost fainted
with jealousy and envy.</p>

<p>Charmant was transported with admiration. He approached
Rosette, his eyes moistened with tears and said to
her:</p>

<p>"Enchanting and lovely princess, I have never heard so
touching a voice. Can I not have the happiness of hearing
you once more?"</p>

<p>Rosette, who was painfully aware of the jealousy of her
sisters, excused herself, saying she was fatigued. Prince
Charmant, who had clear intellect and penetration, divined
the true motive of her refusal and admired Rosette still more
for her delicacy. The queen, irritated by the success of Rosette,
terminated the party at an early hour and retired.</p>

<p>Rosette returned to her little room and undressed herself.
She removed her robe and her ornaments and put
them in a superb case of ebony which she found in her room.
Much to her surprise, she found in her little trunk the robe of
coarse cloth, the pullet feather, the necklace of nuts, the
burrs, the dry beans, the coarse shoes of felt and the blue
yarn stockings. She would not allow herself, however, to be
disquieted, certain that her good godmother would come to
her assistance at the proper time. Rosette was indeed saddened
by the coldness of her parents and the jealousy of her
sisters; but, as she scarcely knew them, this painful impression
was effaced by the remembrance of the Prince Char<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>mant,
who appeared so good and who had been so flattering
in his attention to her. Rosette soon slept peacefully and
awoke late in the morning.</p>

<h3 class="chapter2"><a name="FAMILY_COUNCIL" id="FAMILY_COUNCIL"></a>FAMILY COUNCIL</h3>


<p><span class="dropcap">W</span><span class="upper">hile</span> Rosette was only occupied with smiling<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
and pleasant thoughts, the king, the queen and
the princesses Orangine and Roussette were
choking with rage. They had all assembled in the queen's
apartment.</p>

<p>"This is too horrible," said the princesses. "Why did
you send for this Rosette, who has such dazzling jewels and
makes herself admired and sought after by all these foolish
kings and princes? Was it to humiliate us, my father, that
you called us to the court at this time?"</p>

<p>"I swear to you, my beautiful darlings," said the king,
"that it was by the order of the fairy Puissante I was compelled
to write for her to come. Besides, I did not know that
she was so beautiful and that&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"So beautiful!" interrupted the princesses. "Where do
you find her so beautiful? She is indeed ugly and coarse.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
It is her magnificent attire alone which makes her admired.
Why have you not given to us your most superb jewels and
your richest robes? We have the air of young slovens by
the side of this proud princess."</p>

<p>"And where could I possibly have found jewels as magnificent
as hers? I have none which would compare with
them. It is her godmother, the fairy Puissante, who has lent
her these jewels."</p>

<p>"Why, then, did you summon a fairy to be the godmother
of Rosette, when you gave to us only queens for our
godmothers?"</p>

<p>"It was not your father who called her," cried the queen.
"The fairy Puissante herself, without being called, appeared
to us and signified that she would be Rosette's godmother."</p>

<p>"It is not worth while to spend the time in disputing and
quarrelling," said the king. "It is better to occupy ourselves
in finding some means of getting rid of Rosette and preventing
Prince Charmant from seeing her again."</p>

<p>"Nothing more easy than that," said the queen. "I will
have her despoiled to-morrow of her rare jewels and her
beautiful robes. I will order my servants to seize her and
carry her back to the farm which she shall never leave again."</p>

<p>The queen had scarcely uttered these words, when the
fairy Puissante appeared with an angry and threatening air.
"If you dare to touch Rosette," said she, with a thundering
voice, "if you do not keep her at the palace, if she is not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
present at all the parties, you shall feel the terrible effects
of my anger. You unworthy king and you heartless queen,
you shall be changed into toads and you, odious daughters
and sisters, shall become vipers. Dare now to touch Rosette!"</p>

<p>Saying these words, she disappeared.</p>

<p>The king, the queen and princesses were horribly frightened
and separated without saying a single word but their
hearts were filled with rage. The princesses slept but little
and were yet more furious in the morning when they saw
their eyes heavy and their features convulsed by evil passions.
In vain they used rouge and powder and beat their
maids. They had no longer a vestige of beauty. The king
and queen were as unhappy and as despairing as the princesses
and indeed they saw no remedy for their grief and
disappointment.</p>

<h3 class="chapter2"><a name="SECOND_DAY_OF_THE_FESTIVAL" id="SECOND_DAY_OF_THE_FESTIVAL"></a>SECOND DAY OF THE FESTIVAL</h3>


<p><span class="dropcap">I</span><span class="upper">n</span> the morning a coarse servant brought Rosette bread<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
and milk and offered her services to dress her. Rosette,
who did not wish this rude domestic to see the change in
her dress, thanked her smilingly and replied that she was in
the habit of arranging her hair and dressing herself. Rosette
then began her toilette. When she had washed and
combed her hair she wished to arrange it with the superb
carbuncle she had worn the day before but she saw with surprise
that the ebony case had disappeared and in its place
was a small wooden trunk, upon which there lay a folded
paper. She took it and read the following directions:</p>

<div class="blockquote"><p>"Here are your things, Rosette. Dress yourself as you
were dressed yesterday, in the clothing you brought from
the farm."</p></div>

<p>Rosette did not hesitate an instant, certain that her godmother<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
would come to her help at the proper time. She arranged
her pullet wing in a different manner from that of
the day before, put on her dress, her necklace, her shoes, her
bracelets and then stood before the glass.</p>

<p>When she saw her own reflection in the mirror she was
amazed. She was attired in the richest and most splendid
riding-suit of sky-blue velvet and pearl buttons as large as
walnuts; her stockings were bordered with a wreath of
pearls; her head-dress was a cap of sky-blue velvet with a
long plume of dazzling whiteness, which floated down to
her waist and was attached by a single pearl of unparalleled
beauty and splendor. The boots were also of blue velvet embroidered
in gold and pearls. Her bracelets and necklace
also were of pearls, so large and so pure that a single one
would have paid for the king's palace.</p>

<p>At the moment when Rosette was about to leave her
chamber to follow the page, a sweet voice whispered in her
ear, "Rosette, do not mount any other horse than the one
the prince Charmant will present you."</p>

<p>She turned and saw no one; but she felt convinced that
this counsel came from her good godmother.</p>

<p>"Thanks, dear godmother," she said, in low tones. She
felt a sweet kiss upon her cheek and smiled with happiness
and gratitude.</p>

<p>The little page conducted her, as the day before, into the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
royal salon, where her appearance produced a greater effect
than before. Her fine, sweet countenance, her splendid figure,
her magnificent dress, allured all eyes and captivated all
hearts.</p>

<p>The prince Charmant, who was evidently expecting her,
advanced to meet her, offered his arm and led her to the king
and queen who received her with more coldness than the day
before. Orangine and Roussette were bursting with spite
at the sight of the splendid appearance of Rosette. They
would not even say good-day to their sister.</p>

<p>The good, young princess was of course somewhat embarrassed
by this reception but the prince Charmant, seeing
her distress, approached and asked permission to be her companion
during the chase in the forest.</p>

<p>"It will be a great pleasure to me," replied Rosette, who
did not know how to dissimulate.</p>

<p>"It seems to me," said he, "that I am your brother, so
great is the affection which I feel for you, charming princess.
Permit me to remain by your side and to defend you against
all enemies."</p>

<p>"It will be an honor and a pleasure for me to be protected
by a king so worthy of the name he bears."</p>

<p>Prince Charmant was enchanted by this gracious reply
and, notwithstanding the malice of Orangine and Roussette,
who tried in every possible way to attract him to themselves,
he did not leave Rosette's side for a moment.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span></p>

<p>After breakfast they descended to the court for a ride on
horseback. A page advanced to Rosette, leading a splendid
black horse, which could scarcely be held by the grooms, it
was so wild and vicious.</p>

<p>"You must not ride this horse, princess," said Prince
Charmant, "it will certainly kill you. Bring another horse
for the princess," he said, turning to the page.</p>

<p>"The king and the queen gave orders that the princess
should ride no other horse than this," said the page. At this
the prince exclaimed:</p>

<p>"Dear princess, wait but for a moment; I myself will
bring you a horse worthy of you but I implore you not to
mount this dangerous animal."</p>

<p>"I will wait your return," said Rosette, with a gracious
smile.</p>

<p>A few moments afterwards Prince Charmant appeared,
leading a magnificent horse, white as snow. The saddle was
of blue velvet, embroidered in pearls and the bridle was of
gold and pearls. When Rosette wished to mount, the horse
knelt down and rose quietly when she had placed herself in
the saddle.</p>

<p>Prince Charmant sprang lightly upon his beautiful steed
Alezan and placed himself by the side of the princess Rosette.
The king, the queen and the princesses, who had seen
all this, were pale with rage but they dared say nothing for
fear of the fairy Puissante.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span></p>

<p>The king gave the signal to depart. Every lady had
her attendant gentleman. Orangine and Roussette were
obliged to content themselves with two insignificant princes
who were neither so young nor so handsome as Prince Charmant.
Orangine and Roussette were so sulky that even these
princes declared they would never wed princesses so uninteresting.</p>

<p>In place of following the chase, Prince Charmant and
Rosette wandered in the beautiful shady walks of the forest,
talking merrily and giving accounts of their past lives.</p>

<p>"But," said Charmant, "if the king your father has not
allowed you to reside in his palace, how is it that he has given
you such beautiful jewels, worthy of a fairy?"</p>

<p>"It is to my good godmother that I owe them," replied
Rosette. And then she told Prince Charmant how she had
been educated on a farm and that she was indebted to the
fairy Puissante for everything that she knew and everything
she valued. The fairy had watched over her education and
granted her every wish of her heart.</p>

<p>Charmant listened with a lively interest and a tender
compassion. And now, in his turn, he told Rosette that he
had been left an orphan at the age of seven years; that the
fairy Puissante had presided over his education; that she had
also sent him to the festivals given by the king, telling him
he would find there the perfect woman he was seeking.</p>

<p>"In short, I believe, dear Rosette, that I have found in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
you the charming and perfect creature of whom the fairy
spoke. Deign, princess, to connect your life with mine and
authorize me to demand your hand of your parents."</p>

<p>"Before answering, dear prince, I must obtain permission
of my godmother but you may be sure that I shall be very
happy to pass my life with you."</p>

<p>The morning thus passed away most agreeably for Rosette
and Charmant and they returned to the palace to dress
for dinner.</p>

<p>Rosette entered her ugly garret and saw before her a
magnificent box of rosewood, wide open. She undressed
and as she removed her articles of clothing they arranged
themselves in the box, which then closed firmly. She arranged
her hair and dressed herself with her usual neatness
and then ran to the glass. She could not suppress a cry of
admiration.</p>

<p>Her robe was of gauze and was so fine and light, and
brilliant it looked as if woven of the wings of butterflies. It
was studded with diamonds as brilliant as stars. The hem of
this robe, the corsage and the waist were trimmed with diamond
fringe which sparkled like suns. Her hair was partly
covered with a net of diamonds from which a tassel of immense
diamonds fell to her shoulders. Every diamond was
as large as a pear and was worth a kingdom. Her necklace
and bracelets were so immense and so brilliant that you could
not look at them fixedly without being blinded.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span></p>

<p>The young princess thanked her godmother most tenderly
and felt again upon her fair cheek the sweet kiss of the
morning. She followed the page and entered the royal salon.
Prince Charmant was awaiting her at the door, offered
her his arm and conducted her to the apartment of the king
and queen. Rosette advanced to salute them.</p>

<p>Charmant saw with indignation the glances of rage and
revenge which the king, queen and princesses cast upon poor
Rosette. He remained by her side as he had done in the
morning and was witness to the admiration which she inspired
and the malice and envy of her sisters.</p>

<p>Rosette was indeed sad to find herself the object
of hatred to her father, mother and sisters. Charmant perceived
her melancholy and asked the cause. She explained
it to him frankly.</p>

<p>"When, oh! when, my dear Rosette, will you permit me
to ask your hand of your father? In my kingdom every one
will love you and I more than all the rest."</p>

<p>"To-morrow, dear prince, I will send you the reply of
my godmother whom I shall question on the subject this
evening."</p>

<p>They were now summoned to dinner. Charmant
placed himself at Rosette's side and they conversed in a most
agreeable manner.</p>

<p>After dinner the king gave orders for the ball to commence.
Orangine and Roussette, who had taken lessons for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
ten years, danced well but without any peculiar grace.
They believed that Rosette had never had any opportunity to
dance and with a mocking, malicious air, they now announced
to her that it was her turn.</p>

<p>The modest Rosette hesitated and drew back because it
was repugnant to her to show herself in public and attract
the general regard. But the more she declined, the more her
envious sisters insisted, hoping that she would at last suffer
a real humiliation.</p>

<p>The queen now interfered and sternly commanded Rosette
to dance. Rosette rose at once to obey the queen.
Charmant, seeing her embarrassment, said to her in low
tones:</p>

<p>"I will be your partner, dear Rosette. If you do not
know a single step, let me execute it for you alone."</p>

<p>"Thanks, dear prince. I recognize and am grateful
for your courtesy. I accept you for my partner and hope
that you will not have occasion to blush for your generosity."</p>

<p>And now Rosette and Charmant commenced. A more
animated, graceful and light dance was never seen. All
present gazed at them with ever increasing admiration.
Rosette was so superior in dancing to Orangine and Roussette,
that they could scarcely suppress their rage. They
wished to throw themselves upon the young princess, choke
her and tear her diamonds from her. The king and queen,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
who had been watching them and divined their intention,
stopped them, and whispered in their ears:</p>

<p>"Remember the threats and power of the fairy Puissante!
To-morrow shall be the last day."</p>

<p>When the dance was concluded, the most rapturous applause
resounded throughout the hall and every one entreated
Charmant and Rosette to repeat the dance. As they
felt no fatigue they did not wish to seem disobliging and executed
a new dance, more graceful and attractive than the
first.</p>

<p>Orangine and Roussette could no longer control themselves.
They were suffocating with rage, fainted and were
carried from the room. They had become so marked by the
passions of envy and rage that they had lost every vestige of
beauty and no one had any sympathy for them, as all had seen
their jealousy and wickedness.</p>

<p>The applause and enthusiasm for Rosette and Charmant
were so overpowering that they sought refuge in the garden.
They walked side by side during the rest of the evening, and
talked merrily and happily over their plans for the future, if
the fairy Puissante would permit them to unite the smooth
current of their lives. The diamonds of Rosette sparkled
with such brilliancy that the alleys where they walked and
the little groves where they seated themselves, seemed illuminated
by a thousand stars. At last it was necessary to separate.</p>

<p>"To-morrow!" said Rosette, "to-morrow I hope to say,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
<i>yours eternally</i>."</p>

<p>Rosette entered her little room. As she undressed, her
clothing arranged itself as the day before in the case. This
new case was of carved ivory and studded with turquoise
nails. When Rosette had lain down peacefully upon her
bed she put out the light, and said, in a low voice:</p>

<p>"My dear, good godmother, to-morrow I must give a
definite answer to Prince Charmant. Dictate my response,
dear godmother. I will obey your command, no matter how
painful it may be."</p>

<p>"Say yes, my dear Rosette, to Prince Charmant," replied
the soft voice of the fairy. "I myself arranged this marriage.
It was to make you acquainted with Prince Charmant
that I forced your father to invite you to this festival."</p>

<p>Rosette thanked the kind fairy and slept the sleep of innocence,
after having felt the maternal lips of her good protectress
upon her cheeks.</p>

<p><span class="dropcap">W</span><span class="upper">hile</span> Rosette was thus sleeping peacefully, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
king, the queen, and Orangine and Roussette,
purple with rage, were quarrelling and disputing
amongst themselves. Each was accusing the other of
having brought about the triumph of Rosette and their own
humiliating defeat. One last hope remained for them. In
the morning there was to be a chariot race. Each chariot
was to be drawn by two horses and driven by a lady. It was
resolved to give Rosette a very high chariot, drawn by two
wild, untrained and prancing horses.</p>

<p>"Prince Charmant will have no chariot and horses to exchange,"
said the queen, "as he had this morning in the case
of the riding-horse. It is easy to find a horse for the saddle
but it will be impossible for him to find a chariot ready for
the course."</p>

<p>The consoling thought that Rosette might be killed or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
grievously wounded and disfigured on the morrow brought
peace to these four wicked beings. They retired and
dreamed of the next best means of ridding themselves of
Rosette if the chariot race failed. Orangine and Roussette
slept but little so that in the morning they were still uglier
and more unprepossessing than they had appeared the day
before.</p>

<p>Rosette, who had a tranquil conscience and contented
heart, slept all night calmly. She had been much fatigued
and did not wake till a late hour. Indeed, on rising she
found she had scarcely time to dress. The coarse kitchen
girl brought her a cup of milk and a piece of bread. This
was by order of the queen who directed that she should be
treated like a servant.</p>

<p>Rosette was not difficult to please. She ate the coarse
bread and milk with appetite and began to dress. The case
of carved ivory had disappeared. She put on as usual her
robe of coarse cloth, her pullet's wing, and all the rude ornaments
she had brought from the farm and then looked at herself
in the glass.</p>

<p>She was attired in a riding habit of straw-colored satin,
embroidered in front and at the hem with sapphires and
emeralds. Her hat was of white velvet, ornamented with
plumes of a thousand colors, taken from the plumage of the
rarest birds and attached by a sapphire larger than an egg.
On her neck was a chain of sapphires, at the end of which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
was a watch, the face of which was opal, the back a carved
sapphire and the glass diamond. This watch was always
going, was never out of order and never required to be
wound up.</p>

<p>Rosette heard her page at the door and followed him.
On entering the salon she perceived Prince Charmant, who
was awaiting her with the most lively impatience. He
sprang forward to receive her, offered his arm and said with
eagerness:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Well, dear princess, what did the fairy say to you?
What answer do you give me?"</p>

<p>"That which my heart dictated, sweet prince. I
consecrate my life to you as you have dedicated yours to
me."</p>

<p>"Thanks! a thousand times thanks, dear and bewitching
Rosette. When may I demand your hand of the king your
father?"</p>

<p>"At the close of the chariot race, dear prince."</p>

<p>"Permit me to add to my first petition that of being
married to you this very day. I cannot bear to see you subjected
to the tyranny of your family and I wish to conduct
you at once to my kingdom."</p>

<p>Rosette hesitated. The soft voice of the fairy whispered
in her ear, "Accept." The same voice whispered to
Charmant, "Press the marriage, prince and speak to the king
without delay. Rosette's life is in danger and during eight<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
days from the setting of the sun this evening I cannot watch
over her."</p>

<p>Charmant trembled and repeated the fairy's words to
Rosette, who replied that it was a warning they must not
neglect as it undoubtedly came from the fairy Puissante.</p>

<p>The princess now advanced to salute the king, the queen
and her sisters but they neither looked at her nor spoke to
her. She was however immediately surrounded by a crowd
of kings and princes, each one of whom had himself proposed
to ask her hand in marriage that evening but no one
had an opportunity to speak to her as Charmant never left
her side a single moment.</p>

<p>After the repast they went down to get into the chariots.
The kings and princes were to go on horseback and the ladies
to drive the chariots.</p>

<p>The chariot designed for Rosette by the queen was now
brought forward. Charmant seized Rosette at the moment
she was about to take the reins and lifted her to the ground.</p>

<p>"You shall not enter this chariot, princess. Look at
these wild ungovernable horses."</p>

<p>Rosette now saw that it took four men to hold each of
the horses and that they were prancing and jumping alarmingly.</p>

<p>At this instant a pretty little jockey, attired in a straw-colored
satin vest, with blue ribbon knots, exclaimed in
silvery tones:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>&mdash;</p>

<p>"The equipage of the Princess Rosette!"</p>

<p>And now a little chariot of pearls and mother-of-pearl,
drawn by two magnificent steeds with harness of straw-colored
velvet ornamented with sapphires, drew up before
the princess.</p>

<p>Charmant scarcely knew whether to allow Rosette to
mount this unknown chariot for he still feared some cunning
wickedness of the king and queen. But the voice of the
fairy sounded in his ear:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Allow Rosette to ascend the chariot; these horses are a
present from me. Follow them wherever they may take
Rosette. The day is advancing. I have but a few hours
left in which I can be of service to Rosette and she must be
safe in your kingdom before the day closes."</p>

<p>Charmant assisted Rosette to ascend the chariot and
sprang upon his horse. A few moments afterwards, two
chariots driven by veiled women advanced in front of
Rosette. One of them dashed her chariot with such violence
against that of Rosette, that the little chariot of mother-of-pearl
would inevitably have been crushed had it not been
constructed by fairies. The heavy and massive chariot was
dashed to pieces instead of Rosette's. The veiled woman
was thrown upon the stones, where she remained immovable
whilst Rosette, who had recognized Orangine, tried to stop
her own horses. The other chariot now dashed against that
of Rosette and was crushed like the first and the veiled<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
woman was also dashed upon the stones, which seemed
placed there to receive her.</p>

<p>Rosette recognised Roussette and was about to descend
from her chariot when Charmant interfered, and said:
"Listen, Rosette!"</p>

<p>A voice whispered, "Go, flee quickly! The king is
pursuing you with a great company to kill you both. The
sun will set in a few hours. I have barely time to rescue you
from this danger so give my horses the reins; Charmant,
abandon yours."</p>

<p>Charmant sprang into the chariot by the side of Rosette,
who was more dead than alive. The superb steeds set off
with such marvellous speed that they made more than twenty
leagues an hour. For a long time they knew that they were
pursued by the king with a numerous troop of armed men
but they could not overtake the horses of the fairy. The
chariot still flew on with lightning haste; the horses increased
their speed till at last they made a hundred leagues an hour.
During six hours they kept up this rate and then drew up at
the foot of the stairs of Prince Charmant.</p>

<p>The whole palace was illuminated and all the courtiers
were waiting at the entrance in their most magnificent costumes
to welcome the princess and the prince.</p>

<p>The prince and Rosette were amazed, not knowing how
to understand this unexpected reception. Charmant had
just assisted the princess to descend from the chariot, when<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
they saw before them the fairy Puissante, who said:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Most welcome to your kingdom. Prince Charmant,
follow me; all is prepared for your marriage. Conduct
Rosette to her room that she may change her dress, whilst I
explain to you all the events of this day which seem so incomprehensible
to you. I have one hour at my disposal."</p>

<p>The fairy and Charmant now led Rosette to an apartment,
ornamented with the most exquisite taste, where she
found her maids waiting to attend upon her.</p>

<p>"I will return to seek you in a short time, my dear
Rosette," said the fairy; "my moments are counted."</p>

<p>She departed with Charmant and said to him:&mdash;</p>

<p>"The hatred of the king and queen against Rosette had
become so intense that they had blindly resolved to defy my
vengeance and to get rid of Rosette. Seeing that their cunning
arrangements in the chariot race had not succeeded
after I substituted my horses for those which would certainly
have killed Rosette, they resolved to have recourse to violence.
The king employed a band of brigands, who swore
to him a blind obedience; they pursued your steps with vengeance
in their hearts and as the king knew your love for
Rosette and foresaw that you would defend her to the death,
he was resolved to sacrifice you also to his hatred. Orangine
and Roussette, ignorant of this last project of the king,
attempted to kill Rosette, as you have seen, by dashing
their heavy chariots violently against the light chariot<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
of the princess. I have punished them as they deserved.</p>

<p>"Orangine and Roussette have had their faces so
crushed and wounded by the stones that they have become
frightful. I have aroused them from their state of unconsciousness,
cured their wounds but left the hideous scars to
disfigure them. I have deprived them of all their rich clothing
and dressed them like peasants and I married them at
once to two brutal ostlers whom I commissioned to beat and
maltreat them until their wicked hearts are changed&mdash;and
this I think will never take place.</p>

<p>"As to the king and queen, I have changed them into
beasts of burden and given them to wicked and cruel masters
who will make them suffer for all their brutality to Rosette.
Besides this, they have all been transported into your kingdom
and they will be compelled to hear unceasingly the
praises of Rosette and her husband.</p>

<p>"I have but one piece of advice to give you, dear prince;
hide from Rosette the punishment I have inflicted upon her
parents and sisters. She is so good and tender-hearted that
her happiness would be affected by it, but I ought not and
will not take pity upon wicked people whose hearts are so
vicious and unrepentant."</p>

<p>Charmant thanked the fairy eagerly and promised
silence. They now returned to Rosette, who was clothed in
her wedding-robe, prepared by the fairy Puissante.</p>

<p>It was a tissue of dazzling golden gauze, embroidered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
with garlands of flowers and birds, in stones of all colors, of
admirable beauty; the jewels which formed the birds were so
disposed as to produce, at every motion of Rosette, a warbling
more melodious than the sweetest music. Upon her
head was a crown of flowers made of gems still more beautiful
and rare than those on her robe. Her neck and arms
were covered with carbuncles more brilliant than the sun.</p>

<p>Charmant was completely dazzled by his bride's beauty
but the fairy recalled him from his ecstasy by saying:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Quick! quick! onward! I have but half an hour, after
which I must give myself up to the queen of the fairies and
lose my power for eight days. We are all subject to this
law and nothing can free us from it."</p>

<p>Charmant presented his hand to Rosette and the fairy
preceded them. They walked towards the chapel which was
brilliantly illuminated and here Charmant and Rosette received
the nuptial benediction. On returning to the parlor,
they perceived that the fairy had disappeared, but, as they
were sure of again seeing her in eight days her absence
caused them no anxiety. Charmant presented the new
queen to his court. Everybody found her as charming and
good as the prince and they felt disposed to love her as they
loved him.</p>

<p>With a most amiable and thoughtful attention, the fairy
had transported the farm, upon which Rosette had been so
happy, and all its occupants into Charmant's kingdom.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
This farm was placed at the end of the park, so that Rosette
could walk there every day and see her good nurse. The
fairy had also brought into the palace all those cases which
contained the rich dresses in which Rosette had been so
triumphant at the festivals.</p>

<div class="caption"><i>The fairy must give herself up to the queen and lose her power for eight days</i></div>
<div class="minispace">&nbsp;</div>

<p>Rosette and Charmant were very happy and loved each
other tenderly always. Rosette never knew the terrible
punishment of her father, mother and sisters. When she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
asked Charmant the fate of her sisters, he told her that their
faces were much disfigured by their fall amongst the stones
but they were well and married and the good fairy expressly
forbade Rosette to think of them. She spoke of them no
more.</p>

<p>As to Orangine and Roussette, the more unhappy they
were, the more cruel and wicked their hearts became, so the
fairy allowed them to remain always ugly and in the most
degraded ranks of life.</p>

<p>The king and queen, changed into beasts of burden,
found their only consolation in biting and kicking everything
that came within their reach. They were obliged to
carry their masters to festivals given in honor of Rosette's
marriage and they were mad with rage when they heard the
praises lavished upon the young couple and in seeing Rosette
pass by, beautiful, radiant and adored by Charmant.</p>

<p>The fairy had resolved that they should not return to
their original forms till their hearts were changed. It is said
that six thousand years have passed, and they are still beasts
of burden.</p>

<h2 class="chapter">THE LITTLE GREY MOUSE</h2>

<h3 class="chapter2"><a name="THE_LITTLE_HOUSE" id="THE_LITTLE_HOUSE"></a>THE LITTLE HOUSE</h3>


<p><span class="dropcap">T</span><span class="upper">here</span> was once a man named Prudent, who was a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
widower and he lived alone with his little daughter.
His wife had died a few days after the birth of this
little girl, who was named Rosalie.</p>

<p>Rosalie's father had a large fortune. He lived in a
great house, which belonged to him. This house was surrounded
by a large garden in which Rosalie walked whenever
she pleased to do so.</p>

<p>She had been trained with great tenderness and gentleness
but her father had accustomed her to the most unquestioning
obedience. He forbade her positively to ask him
any useless questions or to insist upon knowing anything he
did not wish to tell her. In this way, by unceasing care and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
watchfulness, he had almost succeeded in curing one of
Rosalie's great faults, a fault indeed unfortunately too common&mdash;curiosity.</p>

<div class="minispace">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="image border3" style="width: 496px; height: 419px;">
<a name="i144" id="i144"></a><img src="images/i144.jpg" width="496" height="419" alt="Rosalie never left the park, which was surrounded by high walls" title="" /></div>
<div class="caption"><i>Rosalie never left the park, which was surrounded by high walls</i></div>
<div class="minispace">&nbsp;</div>

<p>Rosalie never left the park, which was surrounded by
high walls. She never saw any one but her father. They
had no domestic in the house; everything seemed to be done
of itself. She always had what she wanted&mdash;clothing, books,
work, and playthings. Her father educated her himself and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
although she was nearly fifteen years old, she was never
weary and never thought that she might live otherwise and
might see more of the world.</p>

<p>There was a little house at the end of the park without
windows and with but one door, which was always locked.
Rosalie's father entered this house every day and always
carried the key about his person. Rosalie thought it was
only a little hut in which the garden-tools were kept. She
never thought of speaking about it but one day, when
she was seeking a watering-pot for her flowers, she said to
him:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Father, please give me the key of the little house in the
garden."</p>

<p>"What do you want with this key, Rosalie?"</p>

<p>"I want a watering-pot and I think I could find one in
that little house."</p>

<p>"No, Rosalie, there is no watering-pot there."</p>

<p>Prudent's voice trembled so in pronouncing these
words that Rosalie looked up with surprise, and saw that his
face was pale and his forehead bathed in perspiration.</p>

<p>"What is the matter, father?" said she, alarmed.</p>

<p>"Nothing, daughter, nothing."</p>

<p>"It was my asking for the key which agitated you so
violently, father. What does this little house contain which
frightens you so much?"</p>

<p>"Rosalie, Rosalie! you do not know what you are say<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>ing.
Go and look for your watering-pot in the green-house."</p>

<p>"But, father, what is there in the little garden-house?"</p>

<p>"Nothing that can interest you, Rosalie."</p>

<p>"But why do you go there every day without permitting
me to go with you?"</p>

<p>"Rosalie, you know that I do not like to be questioned
and that curiosity is the greatest defect in your character."</p>

<p>Rosalie said no more but she remained very thoughtful.
This little house, of which she had never before thought,
was now constantly in her mind.</p>

<p>"What can be concealed there?" she said to herself.
"How pale my father turned when I asked his permission to
enter! I am sure he thought I should be in some sort of
danger. But why does he go there himself every day? It
is no doubt to carry food to some ferocious beast confined
there. But if it was some wild animal, would I not hear it
roar or howl or shake the house? No, I have never heard
any sound from this cabin. It cannot then be a beast. Besides,
if it was a ferocious beast, it would devour my father
when he entered alone. Perhaps, however, it is chained.
But if it is indeed chained, then there would be no danger
for me. What can it be? A prisoner? My father is good,
he would not deprive any unfortunate innocent of light and
liberty. Well, I absolutely must discover this mystery.
How shall I manage it? If I could only secretly get the key<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
from my father for a half hour! Perhaps some day he will
forget it."</p>

<p>Rosalie was aroused from this chain of reflection by her
father, who called to her with a strangely agitated voice.</p>

<p>"Here, father&mdash;I am coming."</p>

<p>She entered the house and looked steadily at her father.
His pale, sad countenance indicated great agitation.</p>

<p>More than ever curious, she resolved to feign gaiety and
indifference in order to allay her father's suspicions and
make him feel secure. In this way she thought she might
perhaps obtain possession of the key at some future time.
He might not always think of it if she herself seemed to have
forgotten it.</p>

<p>They seated themselves at the table. Prudent ate but
little and was sad and silent, in spite of his efforts to appear
gay. Rosalie, however, seemed so thoughtless and bright
that her father at last recovered his accustomed good spirits.</p>

<p>Rosalie would be fifteen years old in three weeks. Her
father had promised an agreeable surprise for this event. A
few days passed peacefully away. There remained but
fifteen days before her birth-day. One morning Prudent
said to Rosalie:&mdash;</p>

<p>"My dear child, I am compelled to be absent for one
hour. I must go out to arrange something for your birth-day.
Wait for me in the house, my dear. Do not yield
yourself up to idle curiosity. In fifteen days you will know<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
all that you desire to know, for I read your thoughts and I
know what occupies your mind. Adieu, my daughter, beware
of curiosity!"</p>

<p>Prudent embraced his daughter tenderly and withdrew,
leaving her with great reluctance.</p>

<p>As soon as he was out of sight, Rosalie ran to her father's
room and what was her joy to see the key forgotten upon the
table! She seized it and ran quickly to the end of the park.
Arrived at the little house, she remembered the words of her
father, "Beware of curiosity!" She hesitated, and was upon
the point of returning the key without having looked at the
house, when she thought she heard a light groan. She put
her ear against the door and heard a very little voice singing
softly:&mdash;</p>

<div class="block">
<div class="poem">
"A lonely prisoner I pine,<br />
No hope of freedom now is mine;<br />
I soon must draw my latest breath,<br />
And in this dungeon meet my death."<br />
</div></div>

<p>"No doubt," said Rosalie to herself, "this is some unfortunate
creature whom my father holds captive."</p>

<p>Tapping softly upon the door, she said: "Who are
you, and what can I do for you?"</p>

<p>"Open the door, Rosalie! I pray you open the door!"</p>

<p>"But why are you a prisoner? Have you not committed
some crime?"</p>

<p>"Alas! no, Rosalie. An enchanter keeps me here a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
prisoner. Save me and I will prove my gratitude by telling
you truly who I am."</p>

<p>Rosalie no longer hesitated: her curiosity was stronger
than her obedience. She put the key in the lock, but her
hand trembled so that she could not open it. She was about
to give up the effort, when the little voice continued:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Rosalie, that which I have to tell you will teach you
many things which will interest you. Your father is not
what he appears to be."</p>

<p>At these words Rosalie made a last effort, the key turned
and the door opened.</p>

<h3 class="chapter2"><a name="THE_FAIRY_DETESTABLE" id="THE_FAIRY_DETESTABLE"></a>THE FAIRY DETESTABLE</h3>


<p><span class="dropcap">R</span><span class="upper">osalie</span> looked in eagerly. The little house was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
dark; she could see nothing but she heard the little
voice:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Thanks, Rosalie, it is to you that I owe my deliverance."</p>

<p>The voice seemed to come from the earth. She looked,
and saw in a corner two brilliant little eyes gazing at her
maliciously.</p>

<p>"My cunning trick has succeeded, Rosalie, and betrayed
you into yielding to your curiosity. If I had not spoken and
sung you would have returned with the key and I should have
been lost. Now that you have set me at liberty, you and your
father are both in my power."</p>

<p>Rosalie did not yet fully comprehend the extent of the
misfortune she had brought about by her disobedience. She<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
knew, however, that it was a dangerous foe which her father
had held captive and she wished to retire and close the door.</p>

<p>"Stop, Rosalie! It is no longer in your power to keep
me in this odious prison from which I never could have
escaped if you had waited until your fifteenth birth-day."</p>

<p>At this moment the little house disappeared entirely, and
Rosalie saw with the greatest consternation that the key alone
remained in her hand. She now saw at her side a small gray
mouse who gazed at her with its sparkling little eyes and
began to laugh in a thin, discordant voice.</p>

<p>"Ha! ha! ha! What a frightened air you have, Rosalie!
In truth you amuse me very much. But it is lucky for me
that you had so much curiosity. It has been nearly fifteen
years since I was shut up in this frightful prison, having no
power to injure your father, whom I hate, or to bring any
evil upon you, whom I detest because you are his daughter."</p>

<p>"Who are you, then, wicked mouse?"</p>

<p>"I am the mortal enemy of your family, my pet. I call
myself the fairy Detestable and the name suits me, I assure
you. All the world hates me and I hate all the world. I
shall follow you now for the rest of your life, wherever you
go."</p>

<p>"Go away at once, miserable creature! A mouse is not
to be feared and I will find a way to get rid of you."</p>

<p>"We shall see, my pet! I shall remain at your side
wherever you go!"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span></p>

<div class="caption"><i>The broom was on fire at once, blazed up and burned her hands</i></div>
<div class="minispace">&nbsp;</div>

<p>Rosalie now ran rapidly towards the house; every time
she turned she saw the mouse galloping after her, and laughing
with a mocking air. Arrived at the house, she tried to
crush the mouse in the door, but it remained open in spite of
every effort she could make and the mouse remained quietly
upon the door-sill.</p>

<p>"Wait awhile, wicked monster!" cried Rosalie, beside
herself with rage and terror.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span></p>

<p>She seized a broom and tried to dash it violently against
the mouse but the broom was on fire at once, blazed up and
burned her hands; she threw it quickly to the floor and
pushed it into the chimney with her foot, lest it should set fire
to the house. Then seizing a kettle which was boiling on
the fire, she emptied it upon the mouse but the boiling water
was changed into good fresh milk and the mouse commenced
drinking it, saying:&mdash;</p>

<p>"How exceedingly amiable you are, Rosalie! Not
content with having released me from captivity, you give me
an excellent breakfast."</p>

<p>Poor Rosalie now began to weep bitterly. She was
utterly at a loss what to do, when she heard her father
entering.</p>

<p>"My father!" cried she, "my father! Oh! cruel mouse,
I beseech you in pity to go away that my father may not see
you!"</p>

<p>"No, I shall not go but I will hide myself behind your
heels until your father knows of your disobedience."</p>

<p>The mouse had scarcely concealed herself behind
Rosalie, when Prudent entered. He looked at Rosalie,
whose paleness and embarrassed air betrayed her fear.</p>

<p>"Rosalie," said Prudent, with a trembling voice, "I forgot
the key of the little garden-house; have you found it?"</p>

<p>"Here it is, father," said Rosalie, presenting it to him,
and coloring deeply.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span></p>

<p>"How did this cream come to be upset on the floor?"</p>

<p>"Father, it was the cat."</p>

<p>"The cat? Impossible. The cat brought a vessel of
milk to the middle of the room and upset it there?"</p>

<p>"No! no! father, it was I that did it; in carrying it, I
accidentally overturned it."</p>

<p>Rosalie spoke in a low voice, and dared not look at her
father.</p>

<p>"Take the broom, Rosalie, and sweep up this cream."</p>

<p>"There is no broom, father."</p>

<p>"No broom! there was one when I left the house."</p>

<p>"I burned it, father, accidentally, by&mdash;&mdash; by&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>She paused&mdash;her father looked fixedly at her, threw a
searching unquiet glance about the room, sighed and turned
his steps slowly towards the little house in the garden.</p>

<p>Rosalie fell sobbing bitterly upon a chair; the mouse
did not stir. A few moments afterwards, Prudent entered
hastily, his countenance marked with horror.</p>

<p>"Rosalie! unhappy child! what have you done? You
have yielded to your fatal curiosity and released our most
cruel enemy from prison."</p>

<p>"Pardon me, father! oh pardon me!" she cried,
throwing herself at his feet; "I was ignorant of the evil I
did."</p>

<p>"Misfortune is always the result of disobedience,
Rosalie; disobedient children think they are only committing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
a small fault, when they are doing the greatest injury to
themselves and others."</p>

<p>"But, father, who and what then is this mouse, who
causes you this terrible fear? How, if it had so much power,
could you keep it so long a prisoner and why can you not
put it in prison again?"</p>

<p>"This mouse, my unhappy child, is a wicked fairy, but
very powerful. For myself, I am the genius Prudent and
since you have given liberty to my enemy, I can now reveal
to you that which I should have concealed until you were
fifteen years old.</p>

<p>"I am, then, as I said to you, the genius Prudent; your
dear mother was a simple mortal but her virtues and her
graces touched the queen of the fairies and also the king of
the genii and they permitted me to wed her. I gave a splendid
festival on my marriage-day. Unfortunately I forgot to
invoke the fairy Detestable, who was already irritated
against me for having married a princess, after having refused
one of her daughters. She was so exasperated against
me that she swore an implacable hatred against me, my wife
and my children. I was not terrified at her threats, as I myself
had a power almost equal to her own and I was much
beloved by the queen of the fairies. Many times by the
power of my enchantments, I triumphed over the malicious
hatred of the fairy Detestable.</p>

<p>"A few hours after your birth your mother was thrown<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
into the most violent convulsions which I could not calm. I
left her for a few moments to invoke the aid of the queen of
the fairies. When I returned your mother was dead.</p>

<p>"The wicked fairy Detestable had profited by my absence
and caused her death. She was about to endow you
with all the passions and vices of this evil world, when my
unexpected return happily paralyzed her efforts. I interrupted
her at the moment when she had endowed you with a
curiosity sufficient to make you wretched and to subject you
entirely to her power at fifteen years of age. By my power,
united to that of the queen of the fairies, I counter-balanced
this fatal influence and we decided that you should not fall
under her power at fifteen years of age, unless you yielded
three times under the gravest circumstances to your idle
curiosity.</p>

<p>"At the same time the queen of the fairies, to punish the
fairy Detestable, changed her into a mouse, shut her up in
the little garden house, and declared that she should never
leave it unless you voluntarily opened the door. Also, that
she should never resume her original form of fairy unless
you yielded three times to your criminal curiosity before you
were fifteen years of age. Lastly, that if you resisted once
the fatal passion you should be for ever released, as well as
myself, from the power of the fairy Detestable.</p>

<p>"With great difficulty I obtained all these favors and
only by promising that I would share your fate and become,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
like yourself, the slave of the fairy Detestable, if you weakly
allowed yourself to yield three times to your curiosity. I
promised solemnly to educate you in such a manner as to
destroy this terrible passion, calculated to cause so many
sorrows.</p>

<p>"For all these reasons I have confined myself and you,
Rosalie, in this enclosure. I have permitted you to see no
one, not even a domestic. I procured by my power all that
your heart desired and I have been feeling quite satisfied in
having succeeded so well with you. In three weeks you
would have been fifteen, and for ever delivered from the
odious yoke of the fairy Detestable.</p>

<p>"I was alarmed when you asked for the key of the little
house, of which you had never before seemed to think. I
could not conceal the painful impression which this demand
made upon me. My agitation excited your curiosity. In
spite of your gaiety and assumed thoughtlessness, I penetrated
your thoughts, and you may judge of my grief when
the queen of the fairies ordered me to make the temptation
possible and the resistance meritorious by leaving the key at
least once in your reach. I was thus compelled to leave it,
that fatal key, and thus facilitate by my absence my own and
your destruction.</p>

<p>"Imagine, Rosalie, what I suffered during the hour of
my absence, leaving you alone with this temptation before
your eyes and when I saw your embarrassment and blushes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
on my return, indicating to me too well that you had allowed
your curiosity to master you.</p>

<p>"I was commanded to conceal everything from you; to
tell you nothing of your birth or of the dangers which surround
you, until your fifteenth birthday. If I had disobeyed,
you would at once have fallen into the power of the
fairy Detestable.</p>

<p>"And yet, Rosalie, all is not lost. You can yet repair
your fault by resisting for fifteen days this terrible passion.
At fifteen years of age you were to have been united to a
charming prince, who is related to us, the prince Gracious.
This union is yet possible.</p>

<p>"Ah, Rosalie! my still dear child, take pity on yourself,
if you have no mercy for me and resist your curiosity."</p>

<p>Rosalie was on her knees before her father, her face
concealed in her hands and weeping bitterly. At these
words she took courage, embraced him tenderly and said to
him:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Oh, father! I promise you solemnly that I will atone
for this fault. Do not leave me, dear father! With you by
me, I shall be inspired with a courage which would otherwise
fail me. I dare not be deprived of your wise paternal
counsel."</p>

<p>"Alas! Rosalie! it is no longer in my power to remain
with you for I am now under the dominion of my enemy.
Most certainly she will not allow me to stay by your side and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
warn you against the snares and temptations which she will
spread at your feet. I am astonished at not having seen my
cruel foe before this time. The view of my affliction and
despair would have for her hard heart an irresistible charm."</p>

<p>"I have been near you all the time, at your daughter's
feet," said the little gray mouse, in a sharp voice, stepping
out and showing herself to the unfortunate genius. "I have
been highly entertained at the recital of all that I have already
made you suffer, and the pleasure I felt in hearing you give
this account to your daughter induced me to conceal myself
till this moment. Now say adieu to your dear but curious
Rosalie; she must accompany me, and I forbid you to follow
her."</p>

<p>Saying these words, she seized the hem of Rosalie's dress
with her sharp little teeth and tried to draw her away.
Rosalie uttered a piercing cry and clung convulsively to her
father but an irresistible force bore her off. The unfortunate
genius seized a stick and raised it to strike the mouse
but before he had time to inflict the blow the mouse placed
one of her little paws on the genius's foot and he remained as
immovable as a statue. Rosalie embraced her father's knees
and implored the mouse to take pity upon her but the
little wretch gave one of her sharp, diabolical laughs and
said:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Come, come, my pretty! Pity it is not here that you
will find the temptations to yield twice to your irresistible<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
fault! We will travel all over the world together and I will
show you many countries in fifteen days."</p>

<p>The mouse pulled Rosalie without ceasing. Her arms
were still clasped around her father, striving to resist the
overpowering force of her enemy. The mouse uttered a
discordant little cry and suddenly the house was in flames.
Rosalie had sufficient presence of mind to reflect that if she
allowed herself to be burned there would be no means left of
saving her father, who must then remain eternally under the
power of Detestable. Whereas, if she preserved her own
life there remained always some chance of rescuing him.</p>

<p>"Adieu, adieu, dear father!" she cried; "we will meet
again in fifteen days. After having given you over to your
enemy, your Rosalie will yet save you."</p>

<p>She then tore herself away, in order not to be devoured
by the flames. She ran on rapidly for some time without
knowing where she was going. She walked several hours
but at last, exhausted with fatigue and half dead with hunger,
she resolved to approach a kind-looking woman who was
seated at her door.</p>

<p>"Madam," said she, "will you give me a place to sleep?
I am dying with hunger and fatigue. Will you not be so
kind as to allow me to enter and pass the night with you?"</p>

<p>"How is it that so beautiful a girl as yourself is found
upon the highways and what ugly animal is that with the
expression of a demon which accompanies you."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span></p>

<p>Rosalie turned round and saw the little gray mouse
smiling upon her mockingly. She tried to chase it away but
the mouse obstinately refused to move. The good woman,
seeing this contest, shook her head and said:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Go on your ways, my pretty one. The Evil One and
his followers cannot lodge with me."</p>

<p>Weeping bitterly, Rosalie continued her journey, and
wherever she presented herself they refused to receive her
and the mouse, who never quitted her side. She entered a
forest where happily she found a brook at which she
quenched her thirst. She found also fruits and nuts in
abundance. She drank, ate and seated herself near a tree,
thinking with agony of her father and wondering what
would become of him during the fifteen days.</p>

<p>While Rosalie was thus musing she kept her eyes closed
so as not to see the wicked little gray mouse. Her fatigue,
and the silence and darkness around her, brought on sleep
and she slept a long time profoundly.</p>

<h3 class="chapter2"><a name="THE_PRINCE_GRACIOUS" id="THE_PRINCE_GRACIOUS"></a>THE PRINCE GRACIOUS</h3>


<p><span class="dropcap">W</span><span class="upper">hile</span> Rosalie was thus quietly sleeping, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
prince Gracious was engaged in a hunt
through the forest by torch-light. The fawn,
pursued fiercely by the dogs, came trembling with terror to
crouch down near the brook by which Rosalie was sleeping.
The dogs and gamekeepers sprang forward after the fawn.
Suddenly the dogs ceased barking and grouped themselves
silently around Rosalie. The prince dismounted from his
horse to set the dogs again upon the trail of the deer but what
was his surprise to see a lovely young girl asleep in this
lonely forest! He looked carefully around but saw no one
else. She was indeed alone&mdash;abandoned. On examining
her more closely, he saw traces of tears upon her cheeks and
indeed they were still escaping slowly from her closed eyelids.</p>

<p>Rosalie was simply clothed but the richness of her silk<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
dress denoted wealth. Her fine white hands, her rosy nails,
her beautiful chestnut locks, carefully and tastefully arranged
with a gold comb, her elegant boots and necklace of
pure pearls indicated elevated rank.</p>

<p>Rosalie did not awake, notwithstanding the stamping of
the horses, the baying of the dogs and the noisy tumult made
by a crowd of sportsmen.</p>

<p>The prince was stupefied and stood gazing steadily at
Rosalie. No one present recognized her. Anxious and
disquieted by this profound sleep, Prince Gracious took her
hand softly. Rosalie still slept. The prince pressed her
hand lightly in his but even this did not awaken her.</p>

<p>Turning to his officers, he said: "I cannot thus abandon
this unfortunate child, who has perhaps been led astray
by some design, the victim of some cruel wickedness."</p>

<p>"But how can she be removed while she is asleep,
prince," said Hubert, his principal gamekeeper, "can we not
make a litter of branches and thus remove her to some hostel
in the neighborhood while your highness continues the
chase?"</p>

<p>"Your idea is good, Hubert. Make the litter and we
will immediately place her upon it, only you will not carry
her to a hostel, but to my palace. This young maiden is
assuredly of high birth, and she is beautiful as an angel. I
will watch over her myself, so that she may receive the care
and attention to which she is entitled."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span></p>

<p>Hubert, with the assistance of his men, soon arranged
the litter upon which Prince Gracious spread his mantle;
then approaching Rosalie, who was still sleeping softly, he
raised her gently in his arms and laid her upon the cloak.
At this moment Rosalie seemed to be dreaming. She smiled
and murmured, in low tones:&mdash;</p>

<p>"My father! my father! saved for ever! The Queen of
the Fairies! The Prince Gracious! I see him; he is
charming!"</p>

<p>The prince, surprised to hear his name pronounced, did
not doubt that Rosalie was a princess under some cruel enchantment.
He commanded his gamekeepers to walk very
softly so as not to wake her and he walked by the side of the
litter.</p>

<p>On arriving at the palace, Prince Gracious ordered that
the queen's apartment should be prepared for Rosalie. He
suffered no one to touch her but carried her himself to her
chamber and laid her gently upon the bed, ordering the
women who were to wait upon and watch over her to apprise
him as soon as she awaked. Then, casting a farewell look
upon the sad, sweet face of the sleeper, he strode from the
room.</p>

<p>Rosalie slept tranquilly until morning. The sun was
shining brightly when she awoke. She looked about her
with great surprise. The wicked mouse was not near her
to terrify her&mdash;it had happily disappeared.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span></p>

<p>"Am I delivered from this wicked fairy Detestable?"
said she, joyfully. "Am I in the hands of a fairy more
powerful than herself?"</p>

<p>Rosalie now stepped to the window and saw many armed
men and many officers, dressed in brilliant uniforms. More
and more surprised, she was about to call one of the men,
whom she believed to be either genii or enchanters, when she
heard footsteps approaching. She turned and saw the
prince Gracious, clothed in an elegant and rich hunting-dress,
standing before her and regarding her with admiration.
Rosalie immediately recognized the prince of her
dream and cried out involuntarily:&mdash;</p>

<p>"The prince Gracious!"</p>

<p>"You know me then?" said the prince, in amazement.
"How, if you have ever known me, could I have forgotten
your name and features?"</p>

<p>"I have only seen you in my dreams, prince," said
Rosalie, blushing. "As to my name, you could not possibly
know it, since I myself did not know my father's name until
yesterday."</p>

<p>"And what is the name, may I ask, which has been concealed
from you so long?"</p>

<p>Rosalie then told him all that she had heard from her
father. She frankly confessed her culpable curiosity and its
terrible consequences.</p>

<p>"Judge of my grief, prince, when I was compelled to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
leave my father in order to escape from the flames which the
wicked fairy had lighted; when, rejected everywhere because
of the wicked mouse, I found myself exposed to death from
hunger and thirst! Soon, however, a heavy sleep took possession
of me, during which I had many strange dreams. I
do not know how I came here or whether it is in your palace
that I find myself."</p>

<p>Gracious then related to Rosalie how he had found her
asleep in the forest and the words which he had heard her
utter in her dream. He then added:&mdash;</p>

<p>"There is one thing your father did not tell you, Rosalie;
that is, that the queen of the fairies, who is our relation, had
decided that we should be married when you were fifteen
years of age. It was no doubt the queen of the fairies who
inspired me with the desire to go hunting by torchlight, in
order that I might find you in the forest where you had wandered.
Since you will be fifteen in a few days, Rosalie,
deign to consider my palace as your own and command here
in advance, as my queen. Your father will soon be restored
to you and we will celebrate our happy marriage."</p>

<p>Rosalie thanked her young and handsome cousin
heartily and then returned to her chamber, where she found
her maids awaiting her with a wonderful selection of rich
and splendid robes and head-dresses. Rosalie, who had
never given much attention to her toilet, took the first dress
that was presented to her. It was of rose-colored gauze,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
ornamented with fine lace with a head-dress of lace and moss
rosebuds. Her beautiful chestnut hair was arranged in
bands, forming a crown. When her toilet was completed,
the prince came to conduct her to breakfast.</p>

<p>Rosalie ate like a person who had not dined the day before.
After the repast, the prince led her to the garden and
conducted her to the green-houses, which were very magnificent.
At the end of one of the hot-houses there was a
little rotunda, ornamented with choice flowers; in the centre
of this rotunda there was a large case which seemed to contain
a tree but a thick heavy cloth was thrown over it and
tightly sewed together. Through the cloth however could
be seen a number of points of extraordinary brilliancy.</p>

she waited with some impatience for the prince to
remove the cloth which enveloped this mysterious
tree. He left the green-house, however, without having
spoken of it.</p>

<p>"What then, my prince, is this tree which is so carefully
concealed?"</p>

<p>"It is the wedding present which I destined for you but
you cannot see it until your fifteenth birthday," said the
prince, gayly.</p>

<p>"But what is it that shines so brilliantly under the
cloth?" said she, importunately.</p>

<p>"You will know all in a few days, Rosalie, and I flatter
myself that you will not find my present a common affair."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span></p>

<p>"And can I not see it before my birthday?"</p>

<p>"No, Rosalie; the queen of the fairies has forbidden me,
under heavy penalties, to show it to you until after you become
my wife. I do hope that you love me enough to control
your curiosity till that time."</p>

<p>These last words made Rosalie tremble, for they recalled
to her the little gray mouse and the misfortunes which
menaced her as well as her father, if she allowed herself to
fall under the temptation, which, without doubt, her enemy
the fairy Detestable had placed before her. She spoke no
more of the mysterious case, and continued her walk with
the prince. The day passed most agreeably. The prince
presented her to the ladies of his court and commanded them
to honor and respect in her the princess Rosalie, whom the
queen of the fairies had selected as his bride. Rosalie was
very amiable to every one and they all rejoiced in the idea of
having so charming and lovely a queen.</p>

<p>The following days were passed in every species of
festivity. The prince and Rosalie both saw with joyous
hearts the approach of the birth-day which was to be also that
of their marriage:&mdash;the prince, because he tenderly loved his
cousin, and Rosalie because she loved the prince, because she
desired strongly to see her father again, and also because she
hoped to see what the case in the rotunda contained. She
thought of this incessantly. She dreamed of it during the
night and whenever she was alone she could with difficulty<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
restrain herself from rushing to the green-house to try to discover
the secret.</p>

<p>Finally, the last day of anticipation and anxiety arrived.
In the morning Rosalie would be fifteen. The prince was
much occupied with the preparations for his marriage; it
was to be a very grand affair. All the good fairies of his
acquaintance were to be present as well as the queen of the
fairies. Rosalie found herself alone in the morning and she
resolved to take a walk. While musing upon the happiness
of the morrow, she involuntarily approached the green-house.
She entered, smiling pensively, and found herself
face to face with the cloth which covered the treasure.</p>

<p>"To-morrow," said she, "I shall at last know what this
thick cloth conceals from me. If I wished, indeed I might
see it to-day, for I plainly perceive some little openings in
which I might insert my fingers and by enlarging just a
little&mdash;&mdash;. In fact, who would ever know it? I would sew
the cloth after having taken a glimpse. Since to-morrow is
so near, when I am to see all, I may as well take a glance
to-day."</p>

<p>Rosalie looked about her and saw no one; and, in her
extreme desire to gratify her curiosity, she forgot the goodness
of the prince and the dangers which menaced them all
if she yielded to this temptation.</p>

<p>She passed her fingers through the little apertures and
strained them lightly. The cloth was rent from the top to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
the bottom with a noise like thunder and Rosalie saw before
her eyes a tree of marvellous beauty, with a coral trunk and
leaves of emeralds. The seeming fruits which covered the
tree were of precious stones of all colors&mdash;diamonds, sapphires,
pearls, rubies, opals, topazes, all as large as the
fruits they were intended to represent and of such brilliancy
that Rosalie was completely dazzled by them. But scarcely
had she seen this rare and unparalleled tree, when a noise
louder than the first drew her from her ecstasy. She felt
herself lifted up and transported to a vast plain, from which
she saw the palace of the king falling in ruins and heard the
most frightful cries of terror and suffering issue from its
walls. Soon Rosalie saw the prince himself creep from the
ruins bleeding and his clothing almost torn from him. He
advanced towards her and said sadly:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Rosalie! ungrateful Rosalie! see what you have done
to me, not only to me, but to my whole court. After what
you have done, I do not doubt that you will yield a third time
to your curiosity; that you will complete my misfortunes,
those of your unhappy father and your own. Adieu,
Rosalie, adieu! May sincere repentance atone for your ingratitude
towards an unhappy prince who loved you and
only sought to make you happy!"</p>

<p>Saying these words, he withdrew slowly.</p>

<p>Rosalie threw herself upon her knees, bathed in tears
and called him tenderly but he disappeared without ever<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
turning to contemplate her despair. Rosalie was about to
faint away, when she heard the little discordant laugh of the
gray mouse and saw it before her.</p>

<p>"Your thanks are due to me, my dear Rosalie, for having
assisted you so well. It was I who sent you those bewitching
dreams of the mysterious tree during the night. It was I
who nibbled the cloth, to help you in your wish to look in.
Without this last artifice of mine, I believe I should have
lost you, as well as your father and your prince Gracious.
One more slip, my pet, and you will be my slave for ever!"</p>

<p>The cruel mouse, in her malicious joy, began to dance
around Rosalie; her words, wicked as they were, did not excite
the anger of the guilty girl.</p>

<p>"This is all my fault," said she; "had it not been for my
fatal curiosity and my base ingratitude, the gray mouse
would not have succeeded in making me yield so readily to
temptation. I must atone for all this by my sorrow, by my
patience and by the firmness with which I will resist the third
proof to which I am subjected, no matter how difficult it may
be. Besides, I have but a few hours to wait and my dear
prince has told me that his happiness and that of my dearly
loved father and my own, depends upon myself."</p>

<p>Before her lay the smouldering ruins of the palace of the
Prince Gracious. So complete had been its destruction that
a cloud of dust and smoke hung over it, and hardly one stone
remained upon another. The cries of those in pain were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>
borne to her ears and added to her bitterness of feeling.</p>

<p>Rosalie continued to lie prone on the ground. The
gray mouse employed every possible means to induce her to
move from the spot. Rosalie, the poor, unhappy and guilty
Rosalie, persisted in remaining in view of the ruin she had
caused.</p>

<h3 class="chapter2"><a name="THE_CASKET" id="THE_CASKET"></a>THE CASKET</h3>


<p><span class="dropcap">T</span><span class="upper">hus</span> passed the entire day. Rosalie suffered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
cruelly with thirst.</p>

<p>"Ought I not suffer even more than I do?" she
said to herself, "in order to punish me for all I have made my
father and my cousin endure? I will await in this terrible
spot the dawning of my fifteenth birthday."</p>

<p>The night was falling when an old woman who was
passing by, approached and said:&mdash;</p>

<p>"My beautiful child, will you oblige me by taking care
of this casket, which is very heavy to carry, while I go a short
distance to see one of my relations?"</p>

<p>"Willingly, madam," replied Rosalie, who was very
obliging. The old woman placed the casket in her hands,
saying:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>&mdash;</p>

<p>"Many thanks, my beautiful child! I shall not be absent
long. But I entreat you not to look in this casket, for it
contains things&mdash;things such as you have never seen&mdash;and
as you will never have an opportunity to see again. Do not
handle it rudely, for it is of very fragile ware and would be
very easily broken and then you would see what it contains
and no one ought to see what is there concealed."</p>

<p>The old woman went off after saying this. Rosalie
placed the casket near her and reflected on all the events
which had just passed. It was now night and the old woman
did not return. Rosalie now threw her eyes on the casket
and saw with surprise that it illuminated the ground all
around her.</p>

<p>"What can there be in this casket which is so
brilliant?" said she.</p>

<p>She turned it round and round and regarded it from
every side but nothing could explain this extraordinary light
and she placed it carefully upon the ground, saying:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Of what importance is it to me what this casket contains?
It is not mine but belongs to the old woman who
confided it to me. I will not think of it again for fear I may
be tempted to open it."</p>

<p>In fact, she no longer looked at it and endeavored not
to think of it; she now closed her eyes, resolved to wait
patiently till the dawn.</p>

<p>"In the morning I shall be fifteen years of age. I shall<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
see my father and Gracious and will have nothing more to
fear from the wicked fairy."</p>

<p>"Rosalie! Rosalie!" said suddenly the small voice of the
little mouse, "I am near you once more. I am no longer
your enemy and to prove that I am not, if you wish it, I will
show you what this casket contains."</p>

<p>Rosalie did not reply.</p>

<p>"Rosalie, do you not hear what I propose? I am your
friend, believe me."</p>

<p>No reply.</p>

<p>Then the little gray mouse, having no time to lose,
sprang upon the casket and began to gnaw the lid.</p>

<p>"Monster!" cried Rosalie, seizing the casket and pressing
it against her bosom, "if you touch this casket again I
will wring your neck."</p>

<p>The mouse cast a diabolical glance upon Rosalie but it
dared not brave her anger. While it was meditating some
other means of exciting the curiosity of Rosalie, a clock
struck twelve. At the same moment the mouse uttered a cry
of rage and disappointment and said to Rosalie:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Rosalie, the hour of your birth has just sounded. You
are now fifteen; you have nothing more to fear from me.
You are now beyond my power and my temptations as are
also your odious father and hated prince. As to myself, I
am compelled to keep this ignoble form of a mouse until I
can tempt some young girl beautiful and well born as your<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>self
to fall into my snares. Adieu, Rosalie! you can now
open the casket."</p>

<p>Saying these words, the mouse disappeared.</p>

<p>Rosalie, wisely distrusting these words of her enemy,
would not follow her last counsel, and resolved to guard the
casket carefully till the dawn. Scarcely had she taken this
resolution, when an owl, which was flying above her head,
let a stone fall upon the casket, which broke into a thousand
pieces. Rosalie uttered a cry of terror and at the same
moment she saw before her the queen of the fairies, who
said:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Come Rosalie, you have finally triumphed over the
cruel enemy of your family. I will now restore you to your
father but first you must eat and drink, as you are much
exhausted."</p>

<p>The fairy now presented her with a rare fruit, of which a
single mouthful satisfied both hunger and thirst. Then a
splendid chariot, drawn by two dragons, drew up before the
fairy. She entered and commanded Rosalie to do the same.
Rosalie, as soon as she recovered from her surprise, thanked
the queen of the fairies with all her heart for her protection
and asked if she was not to see her father and the prince
Gracious.</p>

<p>"Your father awaits you in the palace of the prince."</p>

<p>"But, madam, I thought that the palace of the prince
was destroyed and he himself wounded sadly?"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span></p>

<p>"That, Rosalie, was only an illusion to fill you with
horror and remorse at the result of your curiosity and to prevent
you from falling before the third temptation. You
will soon see the palace of the prince just as it was before you
tore the cloth which covered the precious tree he destined for
you."</p>

<p>As the fairy said this the chariot drew up before the
palace steps. Rosalie's father and the prince were awaiting
her with all the court. Rosalie first threw herself in her
father's arms, then in those of the prince, who seemed to have
no remembrance of the fault she had committed the day before.
All was ready for the marriage ceremony which was
to be celebrated immediately. All the good fairies assisted
at this festival which lasted several days.</p>

<p>Rosalie's father lived with his child and she was completely
cured of her curiosity. She was tenderly loved by
Prince Gracious whom she loved fondly all her life. They
had beautiful children, for whom they chose powerful fairies
as godmothers in order that they might be protected against
the wicked fairies and genii.</p>

<h3 class="chapter2"><a name="THE_LARK_AND_THE_TOAD" id="THE_LARK_AND_THE_TOAD"></a>THE LARK AND THE TOAD</h3>


<p><span class="dropcap">T</span><span class="upper">here</span> was once a pretty woman named Agnella,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>
who cultivated a farm. She lived alone with a
young servant named Passerose. The farm was
small but beautiful and in fine order. She had a most charming
cow, which gave a quantity of milk, a cat to destroy the
mice and an ass to carry her fruit, butter, vegetables, eggs,
and cheese to markets every Wednesday.</p>

<p>No one knew up to that time how Agnella and Passerose
had arrived at this unknown farm which received in the
county the name of the Woodland Farm.</p>

<p>One evening Passerose was busy milking the pretty
white cow while Agnella prepared the supper. At the moment
she was placing some good soup and a plate of cream<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>
upon the table, she saw an enormous toad devouring with
avidity some cherries which had been put on the ground in a
vine-leaf.</p>

<p>"Ugly toad!" exclaimed Agnella, "I will teach you how
to eat my cherries!" At the same moment she lifted the
leaves which contained the cherries, and gave the toad a kick
which dashed it off about ten steps. She was about to throw
it from the door, when the toad uttered a sharp whistle and
raised itself upon its hind legs; its great eyes were flashing,
and its enormous mouth opening and shutting with rage, its
whole ugly body was trembling and from its quivering throat
was heard a terrible bellowing.</p>

<p>Agnella paused in amazement; she recoiled, indeed, to
avoid the venom of the monstrous and enraged toad. She
looked around for a broom to eject this hideous monster,
when the toad advanced towards her, made with its fore paws
a gesture of authority, and said in a voice trembling with
rage:&mdash;</p>

<p>"You have dared to touch me with your foot! You
have prevented me from satisfying my appetite with the
cherries which you had placed within my reach! You have
tried to expel me from your house! My vengeance shall
reach you and will fall upon that which you hold most dear!
You shall know and feel that the fairy Furious is not to be
insulted with impunity. You shall have a son, covered with
coarse hair like a bear's cub and&mdash;&mdash;"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span></p>

<p>"Stop, sister," interrupted a small voice, sweet and flute-like,
which seemed to come from above. Agnella raised her
head and saw a lark perched on the top of the front door.
"You revenge yourself too cruelly for an injury inflicted,
not upon you in your character of a fairy but upon the ugly
and disgusting form in which it has pleased you to disguise
yourself. By my power, which is superior to yours, I forbid
you to exaggerate the evil which you have already done in
your blind rage and which, alas! it is not in my power to
undo. And you, poor mother," she continued, turning to
Agnella, "do not utterly despair; there is a possible remedy
for the deformity of your child. I will accord to him the
power of changing his skin with any one whom he may, by
his goodness and service rendered, inspire with sufficient
gratitude and affection to consent to the change. He will
then resume the handsome form which would have been his
if my sister, the fairy Furious, had not given you this terrible
proof of her malice and cruelty."</p>

<p>"Alas! madam Lark," replied Agnella, "all this goodness
cannot prevent my poor, unhappy son from being disgusting
and like a wild beast. His very playmates will shun
him as a monster."</p>

<p>"That is true," replied the fairy Drolette; "and the more
so as it is forbidden to yourself or to Passerose to change
skins with him. But I will neither abandon you nor your
son. You will name him Ourson until the day when he can<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
assume a name worthy of his birth and beauty. He must
then be called the prince Marvellous."</p>

<p>Saying these words, the fairy flew lightly through the
air and disappeared from sight.</p>

<p>The fairy Furious withdrew, filled with rage, walking
slowly and turning every instant to gaze at Agnella with a
menacing air. As she moved slowly along, she spat her
venom from side to side and the grass, the plants and the
bushes perished along her course. This was a venom so
subtle that nothing could ever flourish on the spot again and
the path is called to this day the Road of the Fairy Furious.</p>

<p>When Agnella found herself alone, she began to sob.
Passerose, who had finished her work and saw the hour of
supper approaching, entered the dining-room and with great
surprise saw her mistress in tears.</p>

<p>"Dear queen, what is the matter? Who can have
caused you this great grief? I have seen no one enter the
house."</p>

<p>"No one has entered, my dear, except those who enter
everywhere. A wicked fairy under the form of a toad and
a good fairy under the appearance of a lark."</p>

<p>"And what have these fairies said to you, my queen, to
make you weep so piteously? Has not the good fairy interfered
to prevent the misfortunes which the wicked fairy
wished to bring about?"</p>

<p>"No, my dear friend. She has somewhat lightened<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>
them but it was not in her power to set them aside altogether."</p>

<div class="minispace">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="image border3" style="width: 560px; height: 469px;">

<div class="caption"><i>Agnella and Passerose were dashed from cloud to cloud</i></div>
<div class="minispace">&nbsp;</div>

<p>Agnella then recounted all that had taken place and that
she would have a son with a skin like a bear. At this narrative
Passerose wept as bitterly as her mistress.</p>

<p>"What a misfortune!" she exclaimed. "What degradation
and shame, that the heir of a great kingdom should be a
bear! What will King Ferocious, your husband, say if he
should ever discover us?"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span></p>

<p>"And how will he ever find us, Passerose? You know
that after our flight we were swept away by a whirlwind and
dashed from cloud to cloud for twelve hours with such
astonishing rapidity that we found ourselves more than three
thousand leagues from the kingdom of Ferocious. Besides,
you know his wickedness. You know how bitterly he hates
me since I prevented him from killing his brother Indolent
and his sister Nonchalante. You know that I fled because
he wished to kill me also. I have no reason to fear that he
will pursue me for I am sure that he will wish never to see
me again."</p>

<p>Passerose, after having wept and sobbed some time with
the Queen Aimee, for that was her true name, now entreated
her mistress to be seated at the table.</p>

<p>"If we wept all night, dear queen, we could not prevent
your son from being shaggy but we will endeavor to educate
him so well, to make him so good, that he will not be a long
time in finding some good and grateful soul who will exchange
a white skin for this hairy one which the evil fairy
Furious has put upon him. A beautiful present indeed!
She would have done well to reserve it for herself."</p>

<p>The poor queen, whom we will continue to call Agnella
for fear of giving information to King Ferocious, rose
slowly, dried her eyes and succeeded in somewhat overcoming
her sadness. Little by little the gay and cheering conversation
of Passerose dissipated her forebodings. Before<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>
the close of the evening, Passerose had convinced her that
Ourson would not remain a long time a bear; that he would
soon resume a form worthy of a noble prince. That she
would herself indeed be most happy to exchange with him, if
the fairy would permit it.</p>

<p>Agnella and Passerose now retired to their chambers
and slept peacefully.</p>

<h3 class="chapter2"><a name="BIRTH_AND_INFANCY_OF_OURSON" id="BIRTH_AND_INFANCY_OF_OURSON"></a>BIRTH AND INFANCY OF OURSON</h3>


<p><span class="dropcap">T</span><span class="upper">hree</span> months after the appearance of the toad and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
the cruel sentence of the fairy Furious, Agnella
gave birth to a boy whom she named Ourson, as
the fairy Drolette had commanded. Neither Agnella nor
Passerose could decide if he was ugly or handsome for he
was so hairy, so covered with long brown bristles, you could
see nothing but his eyes and his mouth, and not even these
unless he opened them.</p>

<p>If Agnella had not been his mother and if Passerose had
not loved her like a sister, poor Ourson would have died from
neglect for he was so frightful no one would have dared to
touch&mdash;he would have been taken for a little cub and
killed with pitchforks. But Agnella was his mother and her
first movement was to embrace him lovingly and, bathed in
tears, to exclaim:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Poor little Ourson! who can ever love you well enough<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
to deliver you from this horrible curse? Alas! why will not
the fairy permit me to make this exchange, which is allowed
to another who may love you? No one can ever love you as
I do."</p>

<p>Ourson did not reply to these endearments; he slept
peacefully.</p>

<p>Passerose wept also in sympathy with Agnella but she
was not in the habit of afflicting herself for a long time on any
occasion so she dried her eyes and said to Agnella:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Dear queen, I am very certain that your dear son will
be clothed but a short time with this villainous bear-skin and
from this day I shall call him Prince Marvellous."</p>

<p>"I beseech you not to do so," said the queen, anxiously;
"you know that the fairies love to be obeyed."</p>

<p>Passerose took the child, clothed it in the linen that had
been prepared for it and leaned over to embrace it but she
pricked her lips against the rough bristles of Ourson and
drew back precipitately.</p>

<p>"It will not be I who will embrace you frequently, my
boy," said she, in a low voice; "you prick like a real hedgehog."</p>

<p>It was Passerose, however, to whom Agnella gave the
charge of the little Ourson. He had nothing of the bear but
his skin: he was the sweetest-tempered, the most knowing,
the most affectionate child that ever was seen. Passerose
soon loved him with all her heart.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span></p>

<p>As Ourson grew up he was sometimes permitted to leave
the farm. He was in no danger for no one knew him in the
country. The children always ran away at his approach
and the women repulsed him. Men avoided him&mdash;they
looked upon him as something accursed. Sometimes when
Agnella went to market she put him on her donkey and took
him with her and on those days she found more difficulty in
selling her vegetables and cheese. The mothers fled from
her, fearing that Ourson would come too near them.</p>

<p>Agnella wept often and vainly implored the fairy
Drolette. Whenever a lark flew near her, hope was born in
her breast. But the larks, alas, were real larks, fit only to
make pies and not fairies in disguise.</p>

<p><span class="dropcap">O</span><span class="upper">urson</span> at eight years of age was tall and strong,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>
with magnificent eyes and a sweet voice; his bristles
were no longer stiff but his hair was soft as silk, and
those who loved him could embrace him without being
scratched, as Passerose had been the day of his birth. Ourson
loved his mother tenderly and Passerose almost as well
but he was often alone and very sad. He saw too well the
horror he inspired and he saw also that he was unlike other
children.</p>

<p>One day he was walking along a beautiful road which
bordered on the farm. He had walked a long time and overcome
with heat and fatigue he looked about him for some
fresh and quiet spot for repose when he thought he saw a
little object, fair and rosy, a few steps from him. Drawing
near with precaution he saw a little girl asleep. She seemed
to be about three years old and she was beautiful as the Loves<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
and Graces. Her blonde hair partly covered her fair and
dimpled shoulders while her soft cheeks were round and
fresh and dimpled and a half smile played upon her rosy and
parted lips, through which small teeth, white and even as
pearls, could be seen. Her charming head was reposing
upon a lovely rounded arm and the little hand was beautifully
formed and white as snow. The attitude of this little girl
was so graceful, so enchanting, that Ourson stood before
her immovable with admiration. He watched with as much
surprise as pleasure, this child sleeping as soundly and peacefully
in the wood as if she had been at home in her own little
bed. Ourson looked at her a long time and examined her
toilet which was more rich and elegant than anything he had
ever seen. Her dress was of white silk embroidered in gold;
her boots were of blue satin also embroidered in gold; her
stockings were silk and fine as a spider's web; magnificent
bracelets were sparkling upon her arms and the clasp seemed
to contain her portrait; a string of beautiful pearls encircled
her throat.</p>

<p>A lark now commenced its song just above the lovely
little girl and awakened her from her profound slumber.
She looked about her, called her nurse but finding herself
alone in the woods, began to weep bitterly.</p>

<p>Ourson was much affected at her tears and his embarrassment
was very great.</p>

<p>"If I show myself," said he to himself, "this poor little<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>
one will take me for some wild beast of the forest. If she
sees me she will be terrified; she will take to flight and wander
still further from her home. If I leave her here, she will die
of terror and hunger. What shall I do!"</p>

<p>Whilst Ourson reflected thus, the little girl turned
around, saw him, uttered a cry of alarm, tried to flee and fell
back in a panic.</p>

<p>"Do not fly from me, dear little one," said Ourson, in
his sad, soft voice; "I would not injure you for the whole
world; on the contrary, I will assist you to find your father
and mother."</p>

<p>The child gazed at him with staring eyes and seemed
much alarmed.</p>

<p>"Speak to me, little one," said Ourson; "I am not a bear,
as you might suppose, but a poor and most unfortunate little
boy, who inspires every one with terror and whom everybody
avoids."</p>

<p>The sweet child's eyes became calmer and softer, her
fear seemed melting away and she looked undecided.</p>

<p>Ourson took one step towards her but she became
greatly frightened, uttered a sharp cry and tried again to rise
and run off. Ourson paused and began to weep bitterly.</p>

<p>"Unfortunate wretch that I am," he said; "I cannot even
assist this poor lost child. My appearance fills her with terror!
She would rather be lost than have help from me!"</p>

<p>So saying, poor Ourson covered his face with his hands<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
and sobbing piteously threw himself on the ground. A few
moments afterwards he felt a little hand seeking to take possession
of his own. He raised his head and saw the child
standing before him, her eyes filled with tears. She caressed
and patted the hairy cheeks of poor Ourson.</p>

<p>"Don't cry, little cub, don't cry," said she. "Violette is
no longer afraid, she will not run away again. Violette will
love poor little cub. Won't little cub give his hand to Violette?
And if you cry again, Violette will embrace you,
poor little cub."</p>

<p>Tears of happiness and tenderness succeeded those of
despair in Ourson. Violette, seeing that he was again weeping,
approached her soft rosy lips to Ourson's hairy cheek
and gave him several kisses.</p>

<p>"You see, little cub, that Violette is no longer afraid.
Violette kisses you! The little cub won't eat Violette&mdash;she
will follow you!"</p>

<p>If Ourson had followed the dictates of his heart, he
would have pressed her to his bosom and covered with kisses
the good and charming child who overcame her natural terror
in order to assuage the grief and mortification of a poor
being whom she saw unfortunate and miserable. But he
feared to arouse her terrors.</p>

<p>"She would think that I was about to devour her," he
said.</p>

<p>He contented himself, therefore, with clasping her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>
hands softly, and kissing them delicately. Violette permitted
this smilingly.</p>

<p>"Now little cub is satisfied. Little cub will love Violette,
poor Violette, who is lost!"</p>

<p>Ourson understood well that her name was Violette; but
he could not comprehend how this little girl, so richly clad,
was left alone in the forest.</p>

<p>"Where do you live, my dear little Violette?"</p>

<p>"Yonder&mdash;yonder&mdash;with papa and mamma."</p>

<p>"What is the name of your papa?"</p>

<p>"He is the king and dear mamma is the queen."</p>

<p>Ourson was more and more surprised and asked:</p>

<p>"Why are you alone in this forest?"</p>

<p>"Violette doesn't know. Poor Violette rode on a big
dog&mdash;he ran, oh! so fast&mdash;so fast, a long time! Violette was
so tired, she fell down and slept!"</p>

<p>"And the dog, where is he?"</p>

<p>Violet turned in every direction and called softly:</p>

<p>"Ami! Ami!"</p>

<p>No dog appeared.</p>

<p>"Alas! Ami has gone! Poor Violette is alone&mdash;alone!"</p>

<p>Ourson took Violette's hand and she did not withdraw it
but smiled sweetly.</p>

<p>"Shall I go and seek mamma, Violette?"</p>

<p>"No, no! Violette cannot stay all alone in this wood.
Violette will go."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span></p>

<p>"Come, then, with me, dear little girl. I will take you
to my mother."</p>

<p>Ourson and Violette now turned their steps towards the
farm. Ourson gathered strawberries and cherries for Violette,
who would not touch them till Ourson had eaten half.
When she found that he still held his half in his hand, she
took them, and placed them herself in his mouth, saying:</p>

<p>"Eat&mdash;eat, little cub. Violette will not eat unless you
eat. Violette cannot have little cub unhappy. Violette will
not see you weep."</p>

<p>She looked at him to see if he was content and happy.
Ourson was really happy. He saw that his good and pretty
little companion not only tolerated him but was interested in
him and sought to make herself agreeable. His eyes were
sparkling with joy, his voice, always soft and sad, was now
tender. After half an hour's walk, he said to her:</p>

<p>"Violette, you are no longer afraid of poor Ourson, are
you?"</p>

<p>"Oh! no, no, no!" exclaimed she. "Ourson is good&mdash;Violette
will not leave him."</p>

<p>"You are willing, then, that I shall embrace you? you
are no longer afraid of me?"</p>

<p>Violette, without further reply, threw herself in his
arms. Ourson embraced her tenderly and pressed her to his
heart.</p>

<p>"Dear Violette, I will always love you. I will never<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>
forget that you are the only child who was ever willing to
speak to me, touch me or embrace me."</p>

<p>A short time after they arrived at the farm. Agnella
and Passerose were seated at the door, talking together.
When they saw Ourson arrive holding a little girl richly
dressed by the hand, they were so surprised that neither could
utter a word.</p>

<p>"Dear mamma, here is a good and charming little girl
whom I found sleeping in the forest. She is called Violette.
She is very well bred and is not afraid of me. She even embraced
me when she saw me weeping."</p>

<p>"And why did you weep, my poor boy?" said Agnella.</p>

<p>"Because the little girl was afraid of me," said Ourson,
in a sad and trembling voice, "and hurt herself when trying
to run away from me."</p>

<p>"Violette is not afraid now," said she, interrupting him
hastily. "Violette gave her hand to poor Ourson, embraced
him and fed him with cherries and strawberries."</p>

<p>"But what is all this about?" said Passerose. "Why has
our Ourson the charge of this little girl? why was she alone
in the wood? who is she? Answer, Ourson, I do not understand
this."</p>

<p>"I know nothing more than yourself, dear Passerose,"
said Ourson. "I saw this little child asleep in the wood all
alone. She awoke and began to weep. Suddenly she saw
me and cried out in terror. I spoke to her and began to ap<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>proach
her; but she screamed again with fright. I was sorrowful&mdash;oh!
so very sorrowful! I wept bitterly."</p>

<p>"Hush! hush! poor Ourson," exclaimed Violette, putting
her little hand on his mouth; "Violette will certainly
never make you cry again."</p>

<p>While saying these words Violette's voice was trembling
and her sweet eyes were full of tears.</p>

<p>"Good little girl!" said Agnella, embracing her; "you
love our poor Ourson, who is so unhappy!"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes! Violette loves Ourson&mdash;will always love Ourson!"</p>

<p>Agnella and Passerose asked Violette many questions
about her father, mother and country; but they could learn
nothing more from her than she had already told Ourson.
Her father was a king, her mother a queen and she did not
know how she came to be alone in the forest.</p>

<p>Agnella did not hesitate to take under her protection this
poor lost child. She loved her already because of the affection
the little one seemed to entertain for Ourson and because
of the happiness Ourson's whole manner expressed on seeing
himself loved by some one else than his mother and Passerose.</p>

<p>It was now the hour for supper. Passerose laid the
cloth and they all took their seats at the table. Violette asked
to be put at Ourson's side. She was gay and laughed and
talked merrily. Ourson was more happy than he had ever<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>
been. Agnella was contented, and Passerose jumped for joy
on seeing a little playmate for her dear Ourson. In her
transports she spilled a pan of cream which was not lost, however,
as a cat came and licked it up to the last drop. After
supper, Violette fell asleep in her chair.</p>

<p>"Where shall we lay her?" said Agnella. "I have no
bed for her."</p>

<p>"Give her mine, dear mamma," said Ourson; "I can
sleep quite as well in the stable."</p>

<p>Agnella and Passerose at first refused but Ourson insisted
so much upon being allowed to make this little sacrifice,
that they at last consented. Passerose carried Violette
still sleeping in her arms, undressed her without awaking
her and laid her quietly in Ourson's bed, near that of
Agnella. Ourson went to sleep in the stable on the bundles
of hay. He slept peacefully with content in his
heart.</p>

<p>Passerose rejoined Agnella in the parlor. She found
her meditating, with her head resting on her hand.</p>

<p>"Of what are you thinking, dear queen?" said she;
"your eyes are sad, your lips do not smile. I am come to
show you the bracelets of the little stranger. This medallion
ought to open but I have tried in vain to open it. Perhaps
we shall find here a portrait or a name."</p>

<p>"Give it to me, my child. These bracelets are beautiful;
they may aid us, perhaps, in finding a resemblance which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>
presents itself vaguely to my remembrance and which I am
trying in vain to make clear."</p>

<p>Agnella took the bracelets and turned them from side
to side and pressed them in every way, trying to open the medallion,
but she succeeded no better than Passerose had done.</p>

<p>At the moment when, weary of her vain efforts, she returned
them to Passerose, she saw in the middle of the room
a woman glittering as the sun; her face was of dazzling
whiteness, her hair seemed made of threads of gold and a
crown of glittering stars adorned her brow. Her waist was
small and her person seemed transparent, it was so delicate
and luminous; her floating robe was studded with stars like
those which formed her crown. Her glance was soft yet she
smiled maliciously but still with goodness.</p>

<p>"Madam," said she to Agnella, "you see in me the fairy
Drolette, the protectress of your son and of the little princess
whom he brought home this morning from the forest. This
princess is nearly related to you for she is your niece&mdash;the
daughter of your brother-in-law Indolent and sister-in-law
Nonchalante. Your husband succeeded after your flight in
killing Indolent and Nonchalante, who did not distrust him
and who passed all their time in sleeping, eating and lounging.
Unfortunately, I could not prevent this crime as I
was absent assisting at the birth of a prince whose parents
are under my protection, and I forgot myself while playing
tricks upon a wicked old maid of honor and an old chamber<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>lain
who was cruel and avaricious, both of them friends of
my sister, the fairy Furious. But I arrived in time to save
the princess Violette, only daughter and heiress of King Indolent
and Queen Nonchalante. She was playing in the
garden while the king Ferocious was seeking her with his
poniard in his hand. I induced her to mount on the back
of my dog Ami, who was ordered to leave her in the forest
and to that point I directed the steps of the prince your son.
Conceal from both of them their birth and your own and do
not allow Violette to see these bracelets, which contain the
portraits of her father and mother, nor the rich clothing
which I have replaced by other articles better suited to the
quiet existence she will lead here. I have here," said the
fairy, "a casket of precious stones. It contains the happiness
of Violette but you must hide them from all eyes and not
open the casket until she shall have been lost and found."</p>

<p>"I will execute your orders most faithfully, madam, but
I pray you tell me if my unhappy son must long wear his
frightful covering."</p>

<p>"Patience! patience!" cried the fairy, "I watch over you,
over Violette and over your son. Inform Ourson of the faculty
he has of exchanging his skin with any one who loves
him well enough to make this sacrifice for his sake. Remember
that no one must know the rank of Ourson or of
Violette. Passerose, on account of devotion, deserves to be
the only one initiated into this mystery and she can always be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>
trusted. Adieu, queen; count always upon my protection.
Here is a ring, which you must place upon your little finger.
As long as you wear it there you will want for nothing."</p>

<p>Waving her farewell with her hand, the fairy took the
form of a lark and flew away singing merrily.</p>

<p>Agnella and Passerose looked at each other. Agnella
sighed, Passerose smiled.</p>

<p>"Let us hide this precious casket, dear queen, and the
clothing of Violette. I am going now to see what the fairy
has prepared for Violette's dress to-morrow morning."</p>

<p>She ran quickly and opened the wardrobe, and found it
filled with clothing, linen and hosiery, all plain but good and
comfortable. After having looked at all, counted all and
approved all and after having assisted Agnella to undress,
Passerose went to bed and was soon sound asleep.</p>

<h3 class="chapter2"><a name="THE_DREAM" id="THE_DREAM"></a>THE DREAM</h3>


<p><span class="dropcap">I</span><span class="upper">n</span> the morning Ourson was the first awake, aroused by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>
the lowing of the cow. He rubbed his eyes and looked
about him and asked himself why he was in a stable.
Then he recalled the events of the day before, sprang up from
his bundle of hay and ran quickly to the fountain to wash his
face.</p>

<p>While he was washing, Passerose, who had like Ourson
risen at a very early hour and had come out to milk the cow,
left the house-door open. Ourson entered quietly and proceeded
to the chamber of his mother, who was still sleeping.
He drew back the curtains from Violette's bed and found her
sleeping as peacefully as Agnella.</p>

<p>Ourson watched her for a long time and was happy to
see that she smiled in her dreams. Suddenly Violette's brow
contracted and she uttered a cry of alarm, half raised herself
in the bed, and throwing her little arms around Ourson's
neck, she exclaimed:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span></p>

<p>"Ourson! good Ourson! save poor Violette! poor Violette
is in the water and a wicked toad is pulling Violette!"</p>

<p>She now awoke, weeping bitterly, with all the symptoms
of great alarm. She clasped Ourson tightly with her
little arms: he tried in vain to reassure and control her but
she still exclaimed:</p>

<p>"Wicked toad! good Ourson! save Violette!"</p>

<p>Agnella, who had awaked at her first cry, could not yet
understand Violette's alarm but she succeeded at last in calming
her and the child told her dream.</p>

<p>"Violette was walking with Ourson but he did not give
his hand to Violette nor look at her. A wicked toad came
and pulled Violette into the water; she fell and called Ourson;
he came and saved Violette. She loves good Ourson,"
she added, in a tender voice; "will never forget him."</p>

<p>Saying these words, Violette threw herself into his arms.
He, no longer fearing the effect of his bear-skin, embraced
her a thousand times and comforted and encouraged
her.</p>

<p>Agnella had no doubt that this dream was a warning
sent by the fairy Drolette. She resolved to watch carefully
over Violette and to make known to Ourson all that she could
reveal to him without disobeying the fairy.</p>

<p>When she had washed and dressed Violette, she called
Ourson to breakfast. Passerose brought them a bowl of
milk fresh from the cow, some good brown bread and a pot<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>
of butter. Violette, who was hungry, shouted for joy when
she saw this good breakfast.</p>

<p>"Violette loves good milk, good bread, good butter,
loves everything here, with good Ourson and good Mamma
Ourson!"</p>

<p>"I am not called Mamma Ourson," said Agnella, laughing;
"call me only Mamma."</p>

<p>"Oh no, no! not mamma!" cried Violette, shaking her
head sadly. "Mamma! mamma is lost! she was always
sleeping, never walking, never taking care of poor Violette,
never kissing little Violette, Mamma Ourson speaks,
walks, kisses Violette and dresses her. I love Mamma Ourson,
oh, so much!" she said, seizing Agnella's hand and
pressing it to her heart.</p>

<p>Agnella replied by clasping her tenderly in her arms.</p>

<p>Ourson was much moved&mdash;his eyes were moist. Violette
perceived this and passing her hand over his eyes, she
said, entreatingly:</p>

<p>"I pray you don't cry, Ourson; if you cry, Violette must
cry too."</p>

<p>"No, no, dear little girl, I will cry no more. Let us eat
our breakfast and then we will take a walk."</p>

<p>They breakfasted with good appetites. Violette
clapped her hands frequently and exclaimed:</p>

<p>"Oh how good it is! I love it! I am very glad!"</p>

<p>After breakfast, Ourson and Violette went out to walk<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>
while Agnella and Passerose attended to the house. Ourson
played with Violette and gathered her flowers and strawberries.
She said to him:</p>

<p>"We will always walk with each other. You must always
play with Violette."</p>

<p>"I cannot always play, little girl. I have to help
mamma and Passerose to work."</p>

<p>"What sort of work, Ourson?"</p>

<p>"To sweep, scour, take care of the cow, cut the grass and
bring wood and water."</p>

<p>"Violette will work with Ourson."</p>

<p>"You are too little, dear Violette, but still you can try."</p>

<p>When they returned to the house, Ourson started on his
various tasks. Violette followed him everywhere, she did
her best and believed that she was helping him but she was
really too small to be useful. After some days had passed
away, she began to wash the cups and saucers, spread the
cloth, fold the linen and wipe the table. She went to the
milking with Passerose, helped to strain the milk and skim it
and wash the marble flag-stones. She was never out of temper,
never disobedient and never answered impatiently or
angrily.</p>

<p>Ourson loved her more and more from day to day. Agnella
and Passerose were also very fond of her and the more
so because they knew that she was Ourson's cousin.</p>

<p>Violette loved them but Ourson most of all. How<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>
could she help loving this good boy, who always forgot himself
for her, who was constantly seeking to amuse and please
her and who would indeed have been willing to die for his
little friend?</p>

<p>One day, when Passerose had taken Violette with her
to market, Agnella related to Ourson the sad circumstances
which had preceded his birth. She revealed to him the possibility
of his getting rid of his hairy skin and receiving a
smooth white skin in exchange if he could ever find any one
who would voluntarily make this sacrifice from affection
and gratitude.</p>

<p>"Never," cried Ourson, "never will I propose or accept
such a sacrifice. I will never consent to devote a being who
loves me to that life of wretchedness which the vengeance of
the fairy Furious has condemned me to endure; never, from
a wish of mine, shall a heart capable of such a sacrifice suffer
all that I have suffered and all that I still suffer from the fear
and antipathy of men."</p>

<p>Agnella argued in vain against this firm and noble resolve
of Ourson. He declared that she must never again
speak to him of this exchange, to which he would most assuredly
never give his consent and that it must never be
named to Violette or any other person who loved him.</p>

<p>Agnella promised compliance, after a few weak arguments.
In reality she approved and admired his sentiments.
She could not but hope, however, that the fairy Drolette<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>
would recompense the generous and noble character of her
little charge and, by some extraordinary exercise of her
power, release him from his hairy skin.</p>

<h3 class="chapter2"><a name="THE_TOAD_AGAIN" id="THE_TOAD_AGAIN"></a>THE TOAD AGAIN</h3>


<p><span class="dropcap">S</span><span class="upper">ome</span> years passed away in this peaceful manner without<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>
the occurrence of any remarkable event. Ourson
and Violette both grew rapidly. Agnella
thought no more of Violette's frightful dream; her vigilance
had greatly relaxed and she often allowed her to walk alone
or under the care of Ourson.</p>

<p>Ourson was now fifteen years of age and he was tall and
strong. No one could say whether he was handsome or
homely for his long black hair covered his body and face
entirely. He was good, generous and loving&mdash;always
ready to render a service, always contented and cheerful.
Since the day when he had found Violette in the wood his
melancholy had disappeared; he was utterly indifferent to the
general antipathy which he inspired and he no longer walked
in uninhabited places but lived happily in the circle of the
three beings whom he cherished and who loved him supremely.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span></p>

<p>Violette was now ten years old and she had not lost a single
sweet charm of her beauty in growing up. Her eyes
were softer and more angelic, her complexion fresher and
purer, her mouth more beautiful and arch in its expression.
She had grown much in height&mdash;was tall, light and graceful
and her rich blonde hair, when unbound, fell to her feet and
entirely enveloped her like a veil. Passerose had the care of
this superb hair and Agnella never ceased to admire it.</p>

<p>Violette had learned many things during those seven
years. Agnella had taught her how to do housework. In
other things, Ourson had been her teacher. He had taught
her to read, write and keep accounts and he often read aloud
to her while she was sewing. Instructive and amusing
books were found in her room without any one knowing
where they came from. There was also clothing and other
necessary objects for Violette, Ourson, Agnella and Passerose.
There was no longer any necessity for going to market
to sell or the neighboring village to buy. Through the
agency of the ring on Agnella's little finger everything they
wished for, or had need of, was speedily brought to them.</p>

<p>One day when Ourson was walking with Violette she
stumbled against a stone, fell and hurt her foot. Ourson
was frightened when he saw his cherished Violette bleeding.
He did not know what to do to relieve her; he saw how much
she suffered, for, notwithstanding all her efforts, she could
not suppress the tears which escaped from her eyes but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span>
finally he remembered that a brook flowed not ten paces from
them.</p>

<p>"Dear Violette," he said, "lean upon me and we will endeavor
to reach the rivulet&mdash;the fresh water will relieve you."</p>

<p>Violette tried to walk while Ourson supported her. He
succeeded in seating her on the borders of the stream where
she took off her shoe and bathed her delicate little foot in the
fresh flowing water.</p>

<p>"I will run to the house, dear Violette, and bring some
linen to wrap up your foot. Wait for me, I shall not be
long absent and take good care not to get nearer the stream
for this little brook is deep and if you slip you might drown."</p>

<p>When Ourson was out of sight Violette felt an uneasiness
which she attributed to the pain caused by her wound.
An unaccountable repulsion made her feel inclined to withdraw
her foot from the water in which it was hanging. Before
she decided to obey this strange impulse she saw the
water troubled and the head of an enormous toad appear
upon the surface. The great swollen angry eyes of the
loathsome animal were fixed upon Violette, who since her
dream had always had a dread of toads. The appearance
of this hideous creature, its monstrous swollen body and
menacing glance, froze her with such horror that she could
neither move nor cry out.</p>

<div class="caption"><i>&quot;Ah, ha! you are at last in my domain, little fool!&quot;</i></div>
<div class="minispace">&nbsp;</div>

<p>"Ah! ha! you are at last in my domain, little fool!" said
the toad. "I am the fairy Furious, the enemy of your fam<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>ily.
I have been lying in wait for you a long time and should
have had you before if my sister, the fairy Drolette, had
not protected you and sent you a dream to warn you against
me. Ourson whose hairy skin is a talisman of safety is
now absent, my sister is on a journey and you are at last
mine."</p>

<p>Saying these words, she seized Violette's foot with her
cold and shining paws and tried to draw her down into the
water. Violette uttered the most piercing shrieks; she struggled
and caught hold of the plants and shrubs growing on the
borders of the stream. The first, alas, gave way, and Violette
in despair seized hold of others.</p>

<p>"Ourson! oh, Ourson! help! help! dear Ourson, save
me, save your poor Violette! I am perishing! save me!
help! help!"</p>

<p>The fairy Furious, in the form of a toad, was about to
carry her off. The last shrub had given way and Violette's
last cry was hushed.</p>

<p>The poor Violette disappeared under the water just as
another cry, more despairing, more terrible, answered to her
own. But, alas! her hair alone appeared above the water
when Ourson reached the spot, breathless and panting with
terror. He had heard Violette's cries and had turned back
with the rapidity of lightning.</p>

<p>Without a moment's hesitation he sprang into the water
and seized Violette by her long hair but he felt instantly that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span>
he was sinking with her. The fairy Furious was drawing
them to the bottom of the stream. He knew he was sinking
but he did not lose his self-possession. Instead of releasing
Violette, he seized her both arms and invoked the fairy
Drolette. When they reached the bottom, he gave one vigorous
stroke with his heel which brought him again to the
surface. Holding Violette securely with one arm, he swam
sturdily with the other and through some supernatural force
he reached the shore where he deposited the unconscious
Violette.</p>

<p>Her eyes were closed, her teeth tightly clenched and the
pallor of death was on her face. Ourson threw himself on
his knees by her side weeping bitterly. Brave Ourson,
whom no dangers could intimidate, no privation, no suffering
could master, now wept like a child. His sweet sister,
so well beloved! his only friend, his consolation, his happiness
was lying there motionless, lifeless! Ourson's strength
and courage had deserted him and he sank down without
consciousness by the side of his beloved Violette.</p>

<p>At this moment a lark flew rapidly up, approached Violette
and Ourson, gave one stroke of her little beak to Ourson
and another to Violette and disappeared.</p>

<p>Ourson was not the only one who replied to the shrieks
of Violette. Passerose had heard them and then the more
terrible cry of Ourson which succeeded them. She ran to
the house to apprise Agnella and they both ran rapidly to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>ward
the stream from which the cries for help seemed to
come.</p>

<p>On approaching, they saw with surprise and alarm that
Violette and Ourson were lying on the ground in a state of
unconsciousness. Passerose placed her hand on Violette's
heart and felt it still beating. Agnella ascertained at the
same moment that Ourson was still living. She directed
Passerose to take Violette home, undress her and put her to
bed while she endeavored to restore consciousness to Ourson
with salts and other restoratives before conducting him to the
farm. Ourson was too tall and heavy to be carried while
Violette, on the contrary, was light and it was easy for Passerose
to carry her to the house. When she arrived there,
she was soon restored to animation. It was some moments
before she was conscious. She was still agitated with a
vague remembrance of terror but without knowing what had
alarmed her.</p>

<p>During this time the tender care of Agnella had restored
Ourson to life. He opened his eyes, gazed tenderly
at his mother and threw himself weeping upon her
neck.</p>

<p>"Mother, dear mother!" he exclaimed, "my Violette, my
beloved sister, has perished! Let me die with her!"</p>

<p>"Be composed, my son," replied Agnella; "Violette
still lives. Passerose has carried her to the house and will
bestow upon her all the attention she requires."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span></p>

<p>Ourson seemed to revive on hearing these words. He
rose and wished to run to the farm but his second thought
was consideration for his mother and he restrained his impatience
to suit her steps. On their way to the farm he told his
mother all that he knew of the events which had almost cost
Violette and himself their lives. He added that the slime
from the mouth of the fairy Furious had left a strange dulness
in his head.</p>

<p>Agnella now told him how Passerose and herself had
found them stretched unconscious upon the border of the
stream. They soon arrived at the farm, and Ourson, still
dripping, rushed into Violette's presence.</p>

<p>On seeing him Violette remembered everything and she
sprang towards him. She threw her arms around him and
wept upon his bosom. Ourson also wept and Agnella and
Passerose were both in tears. It was a concert of emotion,
enough to soften all hearts. Passerose put an end to it by
crying out:</p>

<p>"Would not one say&mdash;ha! ha!&mdash;that we were the most&mdash;ha!
ha!&mdash;unfortunate people&mdash;ha! ha!&mdash;in the universe!&mdash;Look
at our poor Ourson, wet as a water-reed, bathing himself
in his own and Violette's tears. Courage, children,
courage and happiness! See, we are all alive, thanks to
Ourson."</p>

<p>"Oh, yes!" interrupted Violette; "thanks to Ourson&mdash;to
my dear, my well-beloved Ourson. How shall I ever repay<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span>
him for all I owe him? How can I ever testify my profound
gratitude, my tender affection?"</p>

<p>"By loving me always as you do now, my dear Violette,
my sister. Ah! if it has indeed been in my power to render
you some little service, have you not changed my whole existence?
Have you not made me gay and happy&mdash;me who was
so wretched and so miserable before? Are you not every
day and every hour of the day the consolation and happiness
of my life and of that of my excellent mother?"</p>

<p>Violette was still weeping and she answered only by
pressing more tenderly to her heart her Ourson, her adopted
brother.</p>

<p>"Dear son," said his mother, "you are dripping wet.
Go and change your clothing. Violette has need of some
hours' repose. We will meet again at dinner."</p>

<p>Violette consented to go to bed but did not sleep for her
heart was melting, overflowing with gratitude and tenderness.
She sought in vain for some means of rewarding the
devotion of Ourson. She could think of no other way than
that of trying to become perfect so as to increase the happiness
of Ourson and Agnella.</p>

<h3 class="chapter2"><a name="VIOLETTES_SACRIFICE" id="VIOLETTES_SACRIFICE"></a>VIOLETTE'S SACRIFICE</h3>


<p><span class="dropcap">W</span><span class="upper">hen</span> the dinner hour came, Violette arose,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span>
dressed herself and entered the dining-room
where Agnella and Passerose were awaiting
her. Ourson was not there.</p>

<p>"Ourson is not with you, mother," said Violette.</p>

<p>"I have not seen him," said Agnella.</p>

<p>"Nor I," said Passerose; "I will go and seek him."</p>

<p>She entered his chamber and found him seated upon his
bed, his head resting upon his arm.</p>

<p>"Come, Ourson, come quick; we are waiting dinner for
you."</p>

<p>"I cannot come," said Ourson, in a weak voice; "I have
a strange heaviness in my head."</p>

<p>Passerose flew to inform Agnella and Violette of his illness
and they were by his side in an instant. Ourson made
an effort to rise in order to reassure them but he fell upon a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>
chair. Agnella found that he had a violent fever and she
prevailed upon him to lie down. Violette absolutely refused
to leave him.</p>

<p>"I am the cause of his illness," she said, "and I will not
leave his side till he is well. I shall die of anxiety if you
force me to leave my dear brother."</p>

<p>Agnella and Passerose also installed themselves near
their dear invalid but alas! soon poor Ourson did not recognise
them. He was delirious! He called his mother and
Violette every moment and continued to call them most importunately
and to complain of their absence, even while
they were holding him in their arms.</p>

<p>Agnella and Violette never left him day nor night during
all his sickness. The eighth day, Agnella, exhausted
with fatigue, had fallen asleep near the poor sufferer's bed;
his difficult respiration and lifeless eye seemed to announce
the near approach of death. Violette was on her knees, holding
and pressing in her fine white hands the hairy hands of
Ourson and covering them with tears and kisses.</p>

<p>In the midst of this scene of desolation, a clear sweet
song interrupted the mournful silence of the chamber of the
dying boy. Violette started. This soft melody seemed to
bring consolation and happiness; she raised her head and
saw a lark perched upon the open shutter.</p>

<p>"Violette!" said the lark.</p>

<p>Violette trembled fearfully.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span></p>

<p>"Violette," repeated the little soft voice of the lark, "do
you love Ourson?"</p>

<p>"Do I love him? Ah! love him&mdash;I love him more than
any one else&mdash;more than I love myself."</p>

<p>"Would you purchase his life at the price of your happiness?"</p>

<p>"Yes, gladly would I purchase life for him by the sacrifice
of my happiness and of my own life."</p>

<p>"Listen, then, Violette. I am the fairy Drolette. I
love Ourson, I love you and I love your family. The venom
which my sister the fairy Furious has blown upon the head
of Ourson is sufficient to cause his death. Nevertheless, if
you are sincere, if you really feel for Ourson the sentiments
of gratitude and tenderness which you express, his life is in
your hands. You are permitted to redeem it! But remember
that you will soon be called upon to give the most terrible
proof of your attachment and that if he lives you will pay
for his existence by a most horrible sacrifice."</p>

<p>"Oh, madam! quick, quick, tell me what I am to do to
save my dear Ourson. Nothing will be terrible to me, all
will be joy and happiness if you aid me to save my brother
Ourson."</p>

<p>"Well, my child, very well," replied the fairy. "Kiss his
left ear three times, saying at each kiss: <i>'To thee!&mdash;For thee!&mdash;With
thee!'</i> Reflect again, Violette, before undertaking
this cure. If you are not prepared for the most difficult sac<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span>rifices,
the greatest misfortunes will overwhelm you and my
sister Furious will be the mistress of your life."</p>

<p>As her only reply, Violette crossed her hands upon her
breast, cast upon the fairy, who was about to fly away, a look
of tender gratitude, and, throwing herself upon Ourson, she
kissed his left ear three times, saying, with an accent loving
and penetrating:</p>

<p>"To thee!&mdash;For thee!&mdash;With thee!"</p>

<p>Scarcely had she said these words, when Ourson uttered
a profound sigh, opened his eyes, perceived Violette and
seizing her hands carried them to his lips, saying:</p>

<p>"Violette, dear Violette! it seems to me I am awaking
from a long dream. Tell me all that has passed. Why am
I here? Why are you so pale and thin? Your cheeks are
hollow, you seem to have grown old and your beautiful eyes
are red with weeping."</p>

<p>"Hush!" said Violette, "do not wake your mother, who
is sleeping by your side. She has not slept for a long time
and is much fatigued. You have been very ill, Ourson!"</p>

<p>"And you, dear Violette, have you been resting?"</p>

<p>Violette blushed and hesitated.</p>

<p>"How could I sleep, dear Ourson, when I was the cause
of all your sufferings?"</p>

<p>Ourson was silent. He looked at her tenderly, kissed
her hands and again asked her to tell him what had passed.
She told him but she was too modest and too truly devoted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span>
to reveal to him the price that the fairy had affixed to his cure.
Ourson, therefore, was far from knowing the truth.</p>

<p>Ourson now felt himself restored to health, rose up, proceeded
to his mother softly and awakened her by a kiss. Agnella
thought he was delirious and called Passerose who was
astonished when Violette told them that Ourson had been
restored by the good fairy Drolette.</p>

<p>After all this, Ourson and Violette loved each other
more tenderly than ever and they never left each other unless
their occupations forced them to be apart.</p>

<h3 class="chapter2"><a name="THE_WILD_BOAR" id="THE_WILD_BOAR"></a>THE WILD BOAR</h3>


<p><span class="dropcap">T</span><span class="upper">wo</span> years passed. One day Ourson had been cutting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span>
wood in the forest. Violette was to bring him
his dinner and return with him in the evening. At
midday Passerose hung on Violette's arm a basket containing
wine, bread, a little pot of butter, some ham and some
cherries. Violette set off eagerly. The morning had appeared
to her very long and she was impatient to be again
with Ourson. To shorten the way she went through the forest
which was composed of large trees under which she could
easily walk. There were neither briars nor thorns in her
way and a soft, thick moss covered the earth.</p>

<p>Violette stepped lightly for she was happy to have found
a shorter path to her dear Ourson. When she had passed
over about half the distance she heard the noise of a heavy
and precipitate step but too far off for her to imagine what
it could be. After some moments of expectation she saw<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span>
an enormous wild boar coming towards her. He seemed
greatly enraged, ploughed the ground with his tusks and
rubbed the bark from the trees as he passed along. His
heavy snorting and breathing were as distinctly heard as his
step. Violette did not know where to fly or to hide herself.
While she was hesitating the wild boar came in sight, saw
her, and paused. His eyes were flaming, his whole body
bristling, his tusks clashing together. He uttered a ferocious
grunt, and sprang towards Violette. Happily she
was near a tree whose branches were within her reach. She
seized one, sprang up with it, and climbed from branch to
branch, until she knew she was beyond his reach. Scarcely
was she in safety when the savage animal precipitated himself
with all his weight against the tree in which she had
taken refuge. Furious at this obstacle, he commenced tearing
the bark from the tree and gave it such furious blows
with his snout that Violette was terribly frightened. The
concussion caused by these violent and repeated blows might
at last cause the fall of the tree. She clung tightly and
trembling to the tree. The wild boar at last weary of his useless
attacks laid himself down at the foot of the tree casting
from time to time a menacing look at Violette.</p>

<p>Many hours passed in this painful situation, Violette
trembling but holding on steadily and the wild boar, sometimes
calm, sometimes in a terrible rage, springing against
the tree and tearing it with his tusks.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span></p>

<div class="minispace">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="image border3" style="width: 571px; height: 484px;">
<a name="i224" id="i224"></a><img src="images/i224.jpg" width="571" height="484" alt="Violette takes refuge from the wild boar" title="" /></div>
<div class="caption"><i>Violette takes refuge from the wild boar</i></div>
<div class="minispace">&nbsp;</div>

<p>Violette called on her brother, her dear Ourson, for
help. At every new attempt of the wild boar she renewed
her cries for aid but alas! Ourson was too far off and he
could not hear. No one came to her aid.</p>

<p>Discouragement and despair gained upon her; she began
to feel hunger. She had thrown away the basket of provisions
when she sprang up the tree, the wild boar had
trampled upon it, crushed it and eaten up everything it contained.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span></p>

<p>Whilst Violette was a prey to these terrors and vainly
calling for help Ourson was amazed at not seeing her come
with the dinner.</p>

<p>"Can they have forgotten me?" he said to himself.
"No, neither my mother nor Violette could have forgotten
me. I could not have explained myself well. Without
doubt they expected me back to dinner; they are looking for
me now and are perhaps uneasy."</p>

<p>At this thought Ourson abandoned his work and commenced
walking precipitately towards the house. He also
wished to shorten the way and determined to cross the forest.
Soon he thought he heard plaintive cries of distress. He
paused&mdash;he listened, his heart beat violently as he believed
he recognized the voice of Violette. But, no&mdash;he heard
nothing now. He was about to resume his march when he
heard a more distinct and piercing cry.</p>

<p>Now he knew that it must be Violette, his Violette, who
was in danger and calling upon Ourson for help. He ran
in the direction from which the noise seemed to come. Approaching,
he heard not only calls for help but roars and
growls accompanied by ferocious cries and violent blows.
Poor Ourson ran on with the speed of despair. At last he
perceived the wild boar shaking with his snout the tree upon
which Violette was still crouched in safety though pale and
overcome.</p>

<p>This sight gave him new strength. He invoked the pro<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span>tection
of the good fairy Drolette and rushed upon the wild
boar with his axe in his hand. The wild boar in his rage bellowed
furiously. He gnashed his formidable tusks one
against the other and sprang towards Ourson, who dodged
the attack and jumped to one side. The boar passed beyond
him, paused a moment, then turned more furious than ever
against Ourson who had now taken breath and with his axe
raised in his hand awaited his enemy.</p>

<p>The wild boar sprung on Ourson and received on his
head a most violent blow but his bones were so hard he
scarcely seemed to feel it. The violence of the attack overthrew
Ourson. The wild boar, seeing his enemy on the
ground, did not give him time to rise but sprang upon him
and with his tusks endeavored to tear him to pieces.</p>

<p>Ourson now thought himself lost, indeed he thought no
more of himself, he prayed only for Violette's safety.</p>

<p>Whilst the wild boar was thus trampling and kicking
his enemy, a jeering song was heard just above the combatants.
The wild boar shuddered, suddenly quitted Ourson,
raised his head and saw a lark flying above them. The
mocking song continued and the brute, uttering a cry of
rage, lowered his head and withdrew slowly without once
turning round.</p>

<p>Violette at sight of Ourson's danger had fainted away
but had rested supported by the branches of the tree. Ourson,
who thought himself torn to pieces, scarcely dared at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span>tempt
to move but feeling no pain he rose promptly to assist
Violette. His heart was full of gratitude to the fairy Drolette
to whom he attributed his rescue. At this moment the
lark flew towards him, pecked his cheeks and whispered in
his ear:</p>

<p>"Ourson, it was the fairy Furious who sent this wild
boar. I arrived in time to save you. Profit by the gratitude
of Violette and change skins with her. She will consent
joyfully."</p>

<p>"Never!" cried Ourson. "I would rather be a bear all
my life&mdash;rather die. Poor Violette! I should indeed be
base if I abused her tenderness towards me in this way."</p>

<p>"Good-bye, obstinate one!" said the lark, flying away
singing, "till we meet again. I shall come again&mdash;and
then&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"The result will be the same," said Ourson.</p>

<p>He then climbed the tree, took Violette in his arms, and
descended. He laid her upon the soft green moss and
bathed her forehead with a little wine he found in a broken
bottle.</p>

<p>In a few moments Violette was restored to consciousness.
She could scarcely believe her senses when she saw
Ourson, living and unwounded, kneeling by her side and
bathing her forehead and temples.</p>

<p>"Ourson! dear Ourson! again you have saved my life.
Tell me, oh! tell me, what can I do to prove my gratitude?"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span></p>

<p>"Do not speak of gratitude, my cherished Violette. Do
I not owe all my happiness to you? In saving your life I
save my own and all I value."</p>

<p>"All that you say, dear brother, is sweet and tender but
I desire no less to render you some real and signal service,
which will show all the gratitude and all the love with which
my heart is filled."</p>

<p>"Good! good! we shall see," said Ourson, laughing.
"In the mean time let us think of preserving our lives. You
have eaten nothing since morning, poor Violette, for I see on
the ground the remnants of the provisions you brought, as I
suppose, for our dinner. It is late and the day is declining
so we must hurry to return to the farm before dark."</p>

<p>Violette now tried to rise but her terror and her long fast
had weakened her so much that she fell to the ground.</p>

<p>"I cannot stand, Ourson, I am too weak. What will become
of us?"</p>

<p>Ourson was greatly embarrassed. Violette was no
longer a child and had grown so large that he could not carry
her so far, neither could he leave her exposed to the attacks
of the ferocious beasts of the forest and he feared she could
not do without food till the morning. In this perplexity he
saw a packet fall at his feet. He raised it, opened it and
found a pie, a loaf of bread and a bottle of wine. Ourson
knew that this bounty was from the hand of the fairy Drolette
and with a heart full of gratitude he put the bottle to Vio<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span>lette's
lips. One mouthful of this good wine which was indeed
unequalled restored a portion of Violette's strength.
The pie and the bread completely restored her as well as
Ourson who did full honor to the repast. While eating and
drinking they conversed of their past terrors and present
happiness.</p>

<p>Now, however, it was night and neither Violette nor
Ourson knew which way to turn their steps in order to reach
the farm. They were in the midst of a wood. Violette was
reclining against the tree which had been her refuge from
the wild boar. They dared not quit this spot lest in the obscurity
they might not find as comfortable a one.</p>

<p>"Well, dear Violette, do not be alarmed. It is warm,
the weather is beautiful and you are reclining upon a bed
of soft green moss. Let us pass the night where we are. I
will cover you with my coat and I will lie at your feet to protect
you from all danger and alarm. Mamma and Passerose
will not be very anxious for they are ignorant of the dangers
we have encountered and you know that we have often on a
lovely evening like this reached home after they had retired."</p>

<p>Violette consented willingly to pass the night in the forest.
In the first place, they could not do otherwise; secondly,
she was never afraid with Ourson and always thought
that what he decided to do was right.</p>

<div class="caption"><i>Violette consented willingly to pass the night in the forest</i></div>
<div class="minispace">&nbsp;</div>

<p>Ourson now arranged Violette's bed of moss in the best
possible manner, took off his coat and in spite of her resist<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span>ance
spread it over her. Then, after having seen Violette's
eyes close and sleep take possession of all her senses he lay at
her feet and soon slept most profoundly.</p>

<p>Violette was the first awake in the morning. She
walked around the tree which had sheltered them during the
night. Ourson awaked and not seeing Violette he sprang
up in an instant and called her name in a voice choking with
terror.</p>

<p>"I am here! I am here, dear brother!" she replied, running
towards him; "I am seeking the path to the farm. But
what is the matter? you tremble!"</p>

<p>"I thought you had been carried away by some wicked
fairy, dear Violette, and I reproached myself for having
fallen asleep. Let us go now quickly in order to reach home
before mamma and Passerose are awake."</p>

<p>Ourson knew the forest well. He soon found the path
to the farm and they arrived some moments before Agnella
and Passerose awoke. They agreed to conceal from Agnella
the dangers to which they had been exposed, to spare
her anguish and disquietude for the future. Passerose alone
was made the confidant of their dangerous adventures.</p>

<h3 class="chapter2"><a name="THE_CONFLAGRATION" id="THE_CONFLAGRATION"></a>THE CONFLAGRATION</h3>


<p><span class="dropcap">O</span><span class="upper">urson</span> now forbade Violette to go alone in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span>
forest. She was no longer allowed to carry him
his dinner so he always returned to the house at
midday. Violette never left the farm without Ourson.</p>

<p>Three years after the event in the forest, Ourson saw
Violette arise in the morning pale and exhausted. She was
seeking him.</p>

<p>"Come, come," she said, drawing him along, "I have
something to say&mdash;something to relate&mdash;Oh, come!"</p>

<p>Ourson was much alarmed and followed her precipitately.</p>

<p>"What is it, dear Violette? For the love of Heaven,
speak to me! What can I do for you?"</p>

<p>"Nothing, nothing, dear Ourson; you can do nothing&mdash;only
listen to me. You remember the dream I had in my
childhood, of the toad! the river! the danger! Well, last<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span>
night I had this same dream again. It is terrible! terrible!
Ourson, dear Ourson, your life is menaced! If you die, I
will die also!"</p>

<p>"How! By whom is my life threatened?"</p>

<p>"Listen! I was sleeping and a toad&mdash;still a toad&mdash;always
a toad&mdash;came to me and said:</p>

<p>"'The moment approaches when your dear Ourson is to
resume his natural skin. To you he is to be indebted for this
change. I hate him! I hate you! You shall not make
each other happy! Ourson shall perish and you cannot accomplish
the sacrifice which in your folly you meditate. In
a few days, yes, perhaps in a few hours I shall take a signal
vengeance upon you both. Good-bye&mdash;do you hear?&mdash;till
we meet again!'</p>

<p>"I awoke, suppressed a cry which was about to issue
from my lips and saw, as I saw on that day in which you
saved me from the water, the hideous toad creeping upon the
shutter and gazing at me menacingly. It disappeared, leaving
me more dead than alive. I arose dressed myself and
came to find you my brother, my friend to warn you against
the vengeance of the fairy Furious and to entreat you to seek
the aid of the good fairy Drolette."</p>

<p>Ourson listened in great alarm. He was not frightened
by the fate which menaced himself&mdash;he was agitated by the
sacrifice which Furious announced and which he understood
but too well. The thought alone of his dear and lovely<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span>
Violette being muffled up in his hideous bear's skin through
devotion to him made him tremble and he preferred death.
Ourson's anguish was pictured in his countenance, and Violette,
who was watching him closely, threw herself upon his
neck and sobbed violently.</p>

<p>"Alas! my brother, my dear brother, you will soon be
torn from me. You, who do not know what it is to fear, now
tremble. You who comfort me encourage me and sustain
me in all my fears have now no word to utter to restore my
failing courage. You who have combated the most terrible
dangers now bow your head and are resigned to fate."</p>

<p>"No, Violette, it is not fear which makes me tremble&mdash;it
is not fear which agitates me. It is a word which the fairy
Furious has uttered, of which you do not comprehend the
meaning but which I understand perfectly. The threat was
addressed to you, my Violette. It is for you I tremble!"</p>

<p>Violette divined from this that the moment of sacrifice
had come, that she was about to be called upon to keep the
promise she had made to the fairy Drolette. In place of
trembling and shrinking, she felt the most lively joy. She
could now at last make some return for the devotion, the incessant
watchful tenderness of her dear Ourson&mdash;could in
her turn be useful to him. She made no response to the
fears expressed by Ourson but thanked him and spoke to him
more tenderly than ever before, thinking that soon perhaps
she would be separated from him by death. Ourson had the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span>
same thought. They both fervently invoked the protection
of the fairy Drolette. Ourson, indeed, called upon her in a
loud voice but she did not respond to his appeal.</p>

<p>The day passed away sadly. Neither Ourson nor Violette
spoke to Agnella on the subject of their disquiet for fear
of aggravating her melancholy which had been constantly
increasing as Ourson grew to manhood.</p>

<p>"Already twenty years old!" thought she. "If he persists
in living in this solitude and seeing no one and in refusing
to change with Violette, who asks nothing better, I am
certain, I am convinced, he will wear this bear-skin till his
death."</p>

<p>Agnella wept, often wept; but her tears brought her no
remedy.</p>

<p>The day Violette had her frightful dream, Agnella also
had a dream. The fairy Drolette had appeared to her:</p>

<p>"Courage, queen," she said to her, "in a few days Ourson
will lose his bear's skin and you can give him his true
name of Prince Marvellous."</p>

<p>Agnella had awaked full of hope and happiness. She
redoubled her tenderness to Violette, believing that it was to
her she would owe the happiness of her son.</p>

<p>Every one retired at night with different feelings. Violette
and Ourson, full of anxiety for the future which appeared
so threatening, Agnella's heart bounding with joy
at that same future which appeared so near and so replete<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span>
with happiness, Passerose, astonished at the melancholy of
the one and the joy of the other and ignorant of the cause
of both.</p>

<p>All slept, however. Violette after weeping profusely.
Ourson after having invoked the fairy Drolette; Agnella
after smiling and thinking of Ourson handsome and attractive
and Passerose after saying to herself a hundred times:
"But what is the matter with them all to-day?"</p>

<p>Scarcely an hour after all at the farm were asleep, Violette
was aroused by the smell of fire and smoke. Agnella
awoke at the same moment.</p>

<p>"Mother," said Violette, "do you not smell something?"</p>

<p>"The house is on fire," said Agnella. "Look what a
light is round about us!"</p>

<p>They sprang from their beds and ran to the parlor.
The flames had already taken possession of it and of the
neighboring chambers.</p>

<p>"Ourson! Passerose!" cried Agnella.</p>

<p>"Ourson! Ourson!" exclaimed Violette.</p>

<p>Passerose sprang half clothed into the parlor.</p>

<p>"We are lost, madam! The flames are all through the
house. The doors and windows are firmly closed&mdash;it is impossible
to open them."</p>

<p>"My son! my son!" cried Agnella.</p>

<p>"My brother! my brother!" exclaimed Violette.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span></p>

<p>They ran to the doors; all their efforts to open them or
the windows were ineffectual.</p>

<p>"Oh! my terrible dream!" murmured Violette. "Dear
Ourson, adieu for ever!"</p>

<p>Ourson had also been awakened by the flames and
smoke. He slept out of the farm-house, and near the stable.
His first impulse was to run to the front of the house but notwithstanding
his extraordinary strength he could not open
it. One would have thought that the door would break to
pieces under his efforts. It was evidently held fast by the
fairy Furious.</p>

<p>Ourson sprang upon a ladder and passed across the
flames into a granary through an open window, then descended
into the room where his mother and Violette were
embracing, expecting instant death. Before they had time
to recognize him he seized them in his arms and cried to Passerose
to follow him. He ran along the granary and descended
the ladder with his mother in one arm and Violette
in the other and followed by Passerose. The moment after
they reached the ground in safety, the ladder and granary became
a prey to the flames.</p>

<p>Ourson led Agnella and Violette some distance from the
fire. Passerose was self-possessed: she had quite a large
package of clothing which she had collected at the commencement
of the fire. Agnella and Violette had escaped
barefooted and in their night robes, and the clothing brought<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span>
by Passerose was thus very necessary to protect them from
the cold. After having thanked Ourson for saving their
lives at the peril of his own they complimented Passerose
upon her forethought.</p>

<p>"See," said Passerose, "the advantage of not losing one's
senses. Whilst you two were only thinking of your Ourson,
I made up this package of necessary things."</p>

<p>"That is true, my good Passerose; but what purpose
would your package have served, if my mother and Violette
had perished in the flames?"</p>

<p>"Oh, I knew very well that you would not allow them to
be burned up alive. Is any one ever in danger when you
are present? Is not this the third time you have saved Violette's
life?"</p>

<p>Violette pressed Ourson's hands tenderly and carried
them to her lips. Agnella embraced her and said:</p>

<p>"Dear Violette, Ourson is happy in your tenderness
which fully rewards him for all he has done for you. I feel
assured that on your part you would be happy to sacrifice
yourself for him if an occasion offered, that only too willingly
would you help him."</p>

<p>Before Violette could speak, Ourson said with animation:</p>

<p>"Mother, do not say anything to Violette of sacrificing
herself for me. You know the thought alone makes me
wretched."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span></p>

<p>In place of replying to Ourson, Agnella placed her
hand on her forehead and cried out anxiously:</p>

<p>"The casket, Passerose! the casket! Have you saved
the casket?"</p>

<p>"I forgot it, madam," said Passerose.</p>

<p>The countenance of Agnella expressed such regret and
anxiety, that Ourson questioned her as to this precious casket
which seemed to trouble her so much.</p>

<p>"The casket was a present of the fairy Drolette. She
told me that the happiness of Violette was contained in it. It
was in the wardrobe, at the foot of my bed. Alas! by what
fatality did I forget it?"</p>

<p>She had scarcely uttered these words when the brave
Ourson sprang towards the burning house and notwithstanding
the tears and supplications of Agnella, Violette and Passerose,
disappeared in the flames exclaiming:</p>

<p>"You shall have the casket, mother, or I will perish with
it!"</p>

<p>A horrible silence followed this act of Ourson. Violette
fell on her knees with her arms extended towards the
burning house, Agnella with her hands clasped looked with
straining eyes at the opening through which Ourson had
entered while Passerose was motionless, hiding her face with
her hands. Some moments passed thus and they appeared
ages to the three women who were expecting a sentence of life
or death.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span></p>

<p>Ourson did not reappear. The crackling of the burning
wood, the flashing of the flames, increased in violence.
Suddenly, a frightful noise made Violette and Agnella utter
a cry of despair.</p>

<p>The roof, covered with flames, had fallen in and Ourson
was buried under the ruins&mdash;crushed by the ruins, consumed
by the fire.</p>

<p>The silence of death succeeded this dreadful catastrophe.
The flames diminished, then died away&mdash;no sound
now interrupted the despair of Agnella and Violette.</p>

<p>Violette had fallen into the arms of Agnella and they
sobbed thus a long time in silence. Passerose contemplated
the smoking ruins and wept. Poor Ourson was buried there
a victim of his courage and his devotion! Agnella and Violette
still wept bitterly; they appeared neither to hear nor
understand what was passing around them.</p>

<p>"Let us leave this place," said Passerose, at last.</p>

<p>Agnella and Violette made no response.</p>

<p>Passerose tried to lead Violette away.</p>

<p>"Come," said she; "come, Violette, let us seek a shelter
for the night&mdash;the evening fortunately is mild."</p>

<p>"What shelter do I want?" said Violette. "What is the
evening to me or the morning? There are no more beautiful
days for me! The sun will shine no more but to illumine
my despair!"</p>

<p>"But if we remain here weeping we shall die of hunger,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span>
Violette, and in spite of the bitterest grief, we must think of
the necessities of life."</p>

<p>"Better to die of hunger than of grief! I will not
leave this place where I saw my dear Ourson for the last
time&mdash;where he perished, a victim of his tenderness for
us."</p>

<p>Passerose shrugged her shoulders; she remembered that
the stable had not been burned so she ran there with all speed,
milked the cow, drank a cupful of milk and tried in vain to
make Agnella and Violette do the same.</p>

<p>Agnella rose and said to Violette in a solemn tone:</p>

<p>"Your grief is just, my daughter. Never did a more
noble or generous heart beat in a human form than Ourson's
and he loved you more than he loved himself&mdash;to spare your
grief he sacrificed his happiness and his life."</p>

<p>Agnella now recounted to Violette the scene which preceded
Ourson's birth, the power Violette had to deliver him
from his deformity by accepting it for herself and Ourson's
constant prayer that Violette should never be informed of
the possibility of such a sacrifice.</p>

<p>It is easy to comprehend the feelings of loving tenderness
and regret which filled the heart of Violette after this
confidence and she wept more bitterly than ever.</p>

<p>"And now, my daughter," continued Agnella, "there
remains one duty to fulfil, that is to give burial to my son.
We must clear away these ruins and remove the ashes and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span>
when we have found the remains of our well-beloved Ourson&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Sobs interrupted her speech; she could say no more.</p>

<h3 class="chapter2"><a name="THE_WELL" id="THE_WELL"></a>THE WELL</h3>


<p><span class="dropcap">A</span><span class="upper">gnella,</span> Violette and Passerose walked slowly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span>
towards the burned walls of the farmhouse. With
the courage of despair they removed the smoking
ruins. They worked diligently two days before this work
was completed. No vestige of poor Ourson appeared and
yet they had removed piece by piece, handful by handful, all
that covered the site. On removing the last half-burned
planks, Violette perceived an aperture, which she quickly
enlarged. It was the orifice of a well. Her heart beat violently&mdash;a
vague hope inspired it.</p>

<p>"Ourson!" cried she, with a faint voice.</p>

<p>"Violette! dear Violette! I am here; I am saved!"</p>

<p>Violette could reply only by a smothered cry; she lost
her consciousness and fell into the well which enclosed her
dear Ourson. If the good fairy Drolette had not watched
over her fall, she would have broken her head and limbs<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span>
against the sides of the well. But their kind protectress, who
had already rendered them so many services, sustained her
and she fell safely at Ourson's feet.</p>

<p>Violette soon returned to consciousness. Their happiness
was too great to be believed in&mdash;to be trusted. They did
not cease to give the most tender assurances of affection.
And now they were aroused from their ecstasy by the cries of
Passerose, who, losing sight of Violette and seeking her
amongst the ruins, discovered the open well. Peering into
the darkness she saw Violette's white robe and she imagined
that the poor girl had thrown herself intentionally into the
well and there found the death she sought. Passerose
screamed loud enough to destroy her lungs. Agnella came
slowly forward to know the cause of this alarm.</p>

<p>"Be silent, Passerose," cried Ourson in a loud voice;
"you are frightening our mother. I am in the well with
Violette; we are happy and want for nothing."</p>

<p>"Oh blessed news! blessed news!" cried Passerose; "I
see them! I see them! Madam, madam, come quickly,
quickly! They are here&mdash;they are well&mdash;they have need
of nothing!"</p>

<p>Agnella, pale, and half dead with emotion, listened to
Passerose without comprehending her. She fell on her
knees and had not strength to rise. But when she heard the
voice of her dear Ourson calling to her: "Mother, mother,
your poor son Ourson still lives!" she sprang toward the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span>
well, and would have precipitated herself within, had not
Passerose seized her by the arms and drawn her back suddenly.</p>

<p>"For the love of Ourson, dear queen, do not throw yourself
into this hole; you will kill yourself! I will restore
Ourson and Violette to you unharmed."</p>

<p>Agnella, trembling with happiness, comprehended the
wisdom of the counsel given by Passerose. She remained
rooted to the spot but shuddering with agitation while Passerose
ran to seek a ladder.</p>

<p>Passerose was absent a long time which was excusable
as she was somewhat confused. First she seized a cord, then
a pitchfork, then a chair. For an instant she thought of lowering
the cow to the bottom of the well so that poor Ourson
might have a drink of fresh warm milk. At last she found
the ladder before her eyes, almost in her hands, but she had
not seen it.</p>

<p>While Passerose was seeking the ladder, Ourson and
Violette talked incessantly of their present happiness and the
despair and anguish they had endured.</p>

<p>"I passed uninjured through the flames," said Ourson,
"and sought groping about for the wardrobe of my mother.
The smoke suffocated and blinded me. Then I felt myself
raised by the hair and cast to the bottom of this well where
you have come to join me, dear Violette.</p>

<p>"In place of finding water, or even moisture here, I felt<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span>
at once a sweet, fresh air. A soft carpet was spread on the
bottom: you see it is still here. There was from some source
sufficient light around me. I found ample provisions at my
side. Look at them, Violette, I have not touched them. A
few drops of wine was all I could swallow.</p>

<p>"The knowledge of your despair and that of my mother
rendered me too unhappy and the fairy Drolette took pity
on me. She appeared to me under your form, dear Violette,
and I took her for you and sprang forward to seize you in
my arms but I embraced only a vague form of air or vapor.
I could see her but I could not touch her.</p>

<p>"'Ourson', said the fairy, smiling sweetly upon me, 'I
have assumed Violette's form to testify my friendship in the
most agreeable way. Be comforted; you shall see her to-morrow.
She weeps bitterly, because she believes you to be
dead but I will send her to you to-morrow. She will make
you a visit at the bottom of this well. She will accompany
you when you go forth from this tomb and you shall see your
mother and the blue heavens and the dazzling sun which
neither your mother nor Violette wish to look upon since
your loss, but which appeared beautiful to them while you
were with them. You will return once more to this well for
it contains your happiness.'</p>

<p>"'My happiness!' I exclaimed to the fairy; 'when I have
found my mother and my Violette I shall be in possession of
all my happiness.'<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span></p>

<p>"'Believe implicitly what I say. This well contains
your happiness and that of Violette.'</p>

<p>"'Violette's happiness, madam, is to live with me and
my mother.'"</p>

<p>"Ah! you replied well," interrupted Violette. "But
what said the fairy?"</p>

<p>"'I know what I say,' she answered. 'In a few days
something will be wanting to complete your happiness.
You will find it here. We will meet again, Ourson. Remember
what I have said.'</p>

<p>"'Yes, madam; I hope it will be soon.'</p>

<p>"'When you see me again, my poor child, you will be
scarcely content and then you will wish that you had never
seen me. Silence and farewell.'</p>

<p>"She flew away smiling sweetly, leaving behind her a
delicious perfume and an atmosphere so soft and heavenly
that it diffused a peaceful calm in my heart. I suffered no
more&mdash;I expected you."</p>

<p>Violette on her part comprehended better than Ourson
why the next return of the fairy would be painful to him.
Since Agnella had revealed to her in confidence the nature of
the sacrifice that she could impose upon herself, she was resolved
to accomplish it, in spite of the opposition of Ourson.
She thought only of the delight of giving an immense proof
of her affection. This hope tempered her joy at having
found him.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span></p>

<p>When Ourson had completed his narrative, they heard
the shrill voice of Passerose crying out to them:</p>

<p>"Look, look, my children! the ladder. I will put it
down to you. Take care that it does not fall on your heads.
You must have some provisions down there; send them up,
if you please; we are somewhat destitute above here. For
two days I have only had a little milk to drink and a crust.
Your mother and Violette have lived upon the air and their
tears. Softly! softly! take care not to break the ladder.
Madam! madam! here they are: here are Ourson's and Violette's
heads&mdash;Good! Step up! There you are!"</p>

<p>Agnella, still pallid and trembling, was immovable as
a statue.</p>

<p>After having seen Violette in safety, Ourson sprang
from the well and threw himself into his mother's arms. She
covered him with tears and kisses and held him a long time
clasped to her heart. After having thought him dead during
so many painful hours, it seemed a dream to her almost
impossible to realize that she was holding him safe once
more. Finally Passerose terminated this melting scene by
seizing Ourson and saying to him:</p>

<p>"Now it is my turn! I am forgotten, forsooth, because
I do not bathe myself in tears; because I keep my head cool
and preserve my strength. Was it not Passerose, after all,
who got you out of that terrible hole? Speak the truth."</p>

<p>"Yes, yes, my good Passerose! You may believe that I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span>
love you and indeed I thank you for drawing me out of it
where, however, I was doing very well after my sweet Violette
came down to me."</p>

<p>"But now I think of it," said Passerose, "tell me, Violette,
how did you get to the bottom of that well without killing
yourself?"</p>

<p>"I did not go down purposely. I fell and Ourson received
me in his arms."</p>

<p>"All this is not very clear," said Passerose. "The fairy
Drolette had something to do with it."</p>

<p>"Yes, the good and amiable fairy," said Ourson. "She
is always counteracting the cruelties of her wicked sister."</p>

<p>While thus talking merrily, their stomachs gave indication
that they were suffering for dinner. Ourson had left in
the well the provisions furnished by the fairy. The rest of
the happy family were still embracing and weeping over past
remembrances but Passerose without saying a word descended
into the well and remounted with the provisions
which she placed on a bundle of straw; she then placed
around the table four other bundles of straw for seats.</p>

<p>"Dinner is ready," said she; "come and eat; you all need
food. The good queen and Violette will soon fall from exhaustion.
Ourson has had a little wine but he has eaten
nothing. Here is a pie, a ham, bread and wine. Long life
to the good fairy!"</p>

<p>Agnella, Violette and Ourson did not require to be told<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span>
a second time but placed themselves gayly at the table.
Their appetites were good and the repast excellent. Happiness
illuminated every countenance; they talked, laughed,
clasped each other's hands and were in paradise.</p>

<p>When dinner was over, Passerose was surprised that the
fairy Drolette had not provided for all their wants.</p>

<p>"Look," said she, "the house is in ruins, we are destitute
of everything! The stable is our only shelter, the straw
our only bed and the provisions I brought up from the well
our only food. Formerly everything was provided before
we had the time to ask for it."</p>

<p>Agnella looked suddenly at her hand&mdash;the ring was no
longer there! They must now gain their bread by the sweat
of their brows. Ourson and Violette seeing her air of consternation
demanded the cause of it.</p>

<p>"Alas! my children, you will no doubt think me very
ungrateful to feel disquieted about the future in the midst of
our great happiness but I perceive that during the fire I have
lost the ring given me by the good fairy and this ring would
have furnished us with all the necessaries of life so long as it
was upon my finger. Alas! I have it no longer. What
shall we do?"</p>

<p>"Dismiss all anxiety, dear mother," said Ourson. "Am
I not tall and strong? I will seek for work and you can all
live on my wages."</p>

<p>"And I, too," said Violette, "can I not assist my good<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span>
mother and Passerose? In seeking work for yourself, Ourson,
you can also find something for me to do."</p>

<p>"I will go at once and seek work," said Ourson.
"Adieu, mother. We will meet again, Violette."</p>

<p>Kissing their hands, he set off with a light step.</p>

<p>He had no presentiment, poor boy, of the reception
which awaited him in the three houses where he sought employment.</p>

<h3 class="chapter2"><a name="THE_FARM_THE_CASTLE_THE_FORGE" id="THE_FARM_THE_CASTLE_THE_FORGE"></a>THE FARM&mdash;THE CASTLE&mdash;THE FORGE</h3>


<p><span class="dropcap">O</span><span class="upper">urson</span> walked more than three hours before he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a></span>
arrived at a large and beautiful farm where he
hoped to obtain employment. He saw from a distance
the farmer and his family seated before his front door
taking their evening meal.</p>

<p>He was but a short way off when one of the children, a
little boy about ten years of age, perceived him. He sprang
from his seat, uttered a cry of terror and fled into the house.</p>

<p>A second child, a little girl eight years old, hearing the
cry of her brother turned towards Ourson and commenced
the most piercing shrieks.</p>

<p>All the family now followed the movement of the children
and turned around. At the sight of Ourson the women
cried out with terror and the children fled in wild alarm.
The men seized sticks and pitchforks expecting to be attacked<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[252]</a></span>
by poor Ourson whom they took for some extraordinary
animal escaped from a menagerie.</p>

<p>Ourson, seeing this movement of terror and preparation
for attack, spoke to them hoping to dissipate their fears.</p>

<p>"I am not a bear, as you seem to suppose, but a poor
boy seeking work and who would be very glad if you should
give him employment."</p>

<p>The farmer was greatly amazed to hear a bear speak.
He did not know whether to fly or to interrogate him further.
He resolved, however, to speak.</p>

<p>"Who are you and from whence do you come?"</p>

<p>"I come from the Woodland Farm and I am the son of
Agnella," Ourson replied.</p>

<p>"Ah, then it was you who in your childhood went with
your mother to market and frightened all our children to
death. You have lived in the woods and done without our
help. Why do you seek us now? Go away and live as you
have lived heretofore."</p>

<p>"Our farm-house is burned to the ground. I have to
work now with my hands to support my mother and sister.
For this reason, I pray you to give me work. I will do all
you command me."</p>

<p>"Do you suppose, boy, that I will take into my service a
villainous animal like you who will frighten my wife and my
servants to death and throw my children into convulsions?
I am not quite such a fool, my boy; not quite such a fool.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[253]</a></span>
Enough of this. Be off, and allow us to finish our dinner."</p>

<p>"Master farmer, be merciful. Only try my work.
Place me altogether by myself; then no one will fear me. I
will conceal myself so well that your children shall not see
me."</p>

<p>"Will you be done talking, wicked bear? Go instantly;
if you don't you shall feel the teeth of my pitchfork."</p>

<p>Poor Ourson bowed his head. Tears of humiliation
and disappointment glittered in his eyes. He withdrew
slowly, followed by the coarse laugh and shouts of the farm
hands.</p>

<p>When out of sight he no longer restrained his tears, but
in all this shame and despair the thought that Violette could
take upon herself his ugly covering did not enter his
thoughts.</p>

<p>Ourson walked on till he came in sight of a castle where
he saw a crowd of men coming, going and laboring at every
kind of work. Some were mowing, some raking, some
currying horses, some sweeping, some watering plants, some
sowing.</p>

<p>"Here is a house where I shall certainly find work," said
Ourson to himself. "I see neither women nor children and
I think the men will not be afraid of me."</p>

<p>Ourson drew near without being seen. He took off his
hat and stood before a man who seemed to be the superintendent.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[254]</a></span></p>

<p>"Sir&mdash;" said he.</p>

<p>The man looked up, recoiled a step when he saw Ourson
and examined him with the greatest surprise.</p>

<p>"Who are you and what do you want?" said he, in a
rude voice.</p>

<p>"Sir, I am the son of Agnella, mistress of the Woodland
Farm."</p>

<p>"Well! and what has brought you here?"</p>

<p>"Our house is burned down, sir. I am seeking work in
order to support my mother and sister. I hope you will be
good enough to give me employment."</p>

<p>"Give employment to a bear?"</p>

<p>"Sir, I have only the appearance of a bear. Under this
rough outside, which is so repugnant to you, there beats a
human heart&mdash;a heart capable of gratitude and affection.
You shall have no reason to complain either of my work or
of my good will."</p>

<p>Whilst Ourson spoke and the superintendent listened
with a mocking air, a great noise was heard amongst the
horses. They began to kick and prance and the grooms
could scarcely hold them. Some of them indeed escaped
and fled in terror to the woods.</p>

<p>"It is the bear! It is the bear!" cried the grooms. "It
has terrified the horses. Drive it off! Chase it away! We
cannot control our horses."</p>

<p>"Off with you!" cried the superintendent.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[255]</a></span></p>

<p>Ourson was stupefied by his misfortunes and was immovable.</p>

<p>"Ha! you will not go," vociferated the man. "Wait a
few moments, you hairy beast. I will give you something to
run for. Halloa, men! bring out the dogs, and set them
upon this animal. Hurry!&mdash;see him scampering off!"</p>

<p>In fact Ourson, more dead than alive at this cruel treatment,
precipitately withdrew from the presence of these
wicked and inhuman men. This second attempt had failed
utterly but he would not allow himself to be discouraged.</p>

<p>"It is still three or four hours before sunset so I have
time to continue my search for work."</p>

<p>He directed his steps towards a forge which was some
distance from Woodland Farm. The master of the forge
employed a great many workmen. He gave work to those
who asked it, not in charity, but in view of his own interest.
He was feared but he was not loved. He developed the
riches of the country but no one thanked him for it because
he alone profited by it. By his avidity and his opulence he
ground down the poor workmen who could only find employment
with this new Marquis of Carabas.</p>

<p>Poor Ourson arrived at the forge. The master was at
the door, scolding some, threatening others and terrifying
all.</p>

<p>"Sir," said Ourson, drawing near, "have you any work
to give me?"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[256]</a></span></p>

<p>"Certainly. What kind of work&mdash;&mdash;?"</p>

<p>He raised his head at these words for he had replied
without looking at Ourson. When his eye fell upon him he
did not finish his phrase; his eyes flashed with rage and he
stammered out:&mdash;</p>

<p>"What foolery is this? Are we in the midst of the
Carnival, that a workman ventures upon such a ridiculous
masquerade? Throw off your ugly bear's skin instantly or
I will crisp your bristles for you in my fire."</p>

<p>"This, sir, is no masquerade," replied Ourson, sadly; "it
is, alas! my natural skin but if you will be humane enough
to employ me you will see that my strength is equal to my
goodwill."</p>

<p>"I give work to you, you vile animal!" cried the master
of the forge, foaming with rage: "I will put you into a sack
and send you to a menagerie or I will throw you into a den
with your brother bears. You will have work enough to
defend yourself from their claws. Be off!"</p>

<p>And brandishing his club he would have dealt Ourson a
heavy blow if the poor boy had not made a hasty retreat.</p>

<h3 class="chapter2"><a name="THE_SACRIFICE" id="THE_SACRIFICE"></a>THE SACRIFICE</h3>


<p><span class="dropcap">O</span><span class="upper">urson</span> turned his steps homeward, discouraged<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[257]</a></span>
and exhausted. He walked slowly and arrived at
the farm late. Violette ran to meet him, took him
by the hand, and without saying a word led him to his mother.
There she fell on her knees and said:&mdash;</p>

<p>"My mother, I know what our well-beloved Ourson has
suffered to-day. During his absence the fairy Furious has
told me all and the good fairy Drolette has confirmed her
story. My mother, when our Ourson was, as we believed,
lost to us for ever and lost for my sake you revealed to me that
which in his nobility and goodness he wished to conceal. I
know that by changing skins with him I can restore to him
his original beauty. Happy, a hundred times happy in having
this opportunity to recompense the tenderness and devotion
of my dearly-loved brother Ourson, I demand to make
this exchange allowed by the fairy Drolette and I entreat her
to complete the transfer immediately."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[258]</a></span></p>

<p>"Violette! Violette!" exclaimed Ourson, in great agitation,
"take back your words! You do not know to what you
engage yourself; you are ignorant of the life of anguish and
misery unparalleled, the life of solitude and isolation to
which you thus condemn yourself; you know not the unceasing
desolation you will feel at knowing that you are an
object of fear to all mankind. Violette, Violette, in pity to
me, withdraw your words!"</p>

<p>"Dear Ourson," said Violette, calmly, but resolutely,
"in making what you believe to be so great a sacrifice, I accomplish
the dearest wish of my heart; I secure my own
happiness; I satisfy an ardent and imperious desire to testify
my tenderness and my gratitude. I esteem myself for doing
what I propose. I should despise myself if I left it undone."</p>

<p>"Pause, Violette, for one instant longer, I beseech you!
Think of my grief, when I no longer see my beautiful Violette,
when I think of you exposed to the railleries, the horror
of men. Oh! Violette, do not condemn your poor Ourson
to this anguish."</p>

<p>The lovely face of Violette was veiled with sadness.
The fear that Ourson would feel repugnance towards her
made her heart tremble; but this thought, which was wholly
personal, was very fleeting&mdash;it could not triumph over her
devoted tenderness. Her only response was to throw herself
in the arms of Agnella, and say:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[259]</a></span>&mdash;</p>

<p>"Mother, embrace your fair and pretty Violette for the
last time."</p>

<p>Whilst Agnella, Ourson and Passerose embraced her
and looked lovingly upon her&mdash;whilst Ourson, on his knees,
supplicated her to leave him his bear-skin to which he had
been accustomed for twenty years&mdash;Violette called out again
in a loud voice:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Fairy Drolette! Fairy Drolette! come and accept the
price of the life and health of my dear Ourson."</p>

<p>At this moment the fairy Drolette appeared in all her
glory. She was seated in a massive chariot of gold, drawn
by a hundred and fifty larks. She was clothed with a robe
of butterflies' wings, of the most brilliant colors while from
her shoulders fell a mantle of network of diamonds, which
trailed ten feet behind her and it was so fine in texture that it
was light as gauze. Her hair, glittering like tissue of gold,
was ornamented by a crown of carbuncles more brilliant
than the sun; each of her slippers was carved from a single
ruby and her beautiful face, soft, yet gay, breathed contentment.
She fixed upon Violette a most affectionate regard.</p>

<p>"You wish it, then, my daughter?" said she.</p>

<p>"Madam," cried Ourson, falling at her feet, "deign to
listen to me. You, who have loaded me with undeserved
benefits&mdash;you, who have inspired me with boundless gratitude&mdash;you,
good and just&mdash;will you execute the mad wish of
my dear Violette? Will you make my whole life wretched<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[260]</a></span>
by forcing me to accept this sacrifice? No, no, charming
and humane fairy, you could not, you will not do it!"</p>

<p>Whilst Ourson was thus supplicating, the fairy gave
Violette a light touch with her wand of pearl and Ourson
another&mdash;then said:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Let it be according to the wish of your heart, my
daughter. Let it be contrary to your ardent desires, my
son."</p>

<p>At the same moment, the face, arms and the whole body
of the lovely young girl were covered with the long hair
which Ourson had worn, and Ourson appeared with a white
smooth skin, which set off his extreme beauty to advantage.</p>

<p>Violette gazed at him with admiration, while he, his eyes
cast down and full of tears, dared not look at his poor Violette,
so horribly metamorphosed. At last he looked up,
threw himself in her arms, and they wept together.</p>

<p>Ourson was marvellously handsome. Violette was, as
Ourson had been, without form, without beauty, but not
ugly. When Violette raised her head and looked at Agnella,
the latter extended her hands towards her, and said:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Thanks, my daughter, my noble, generous child."</p>

<p>"Mother," said Violette, in low voice, "do you love me
still?"</p>

<p>"Do I love you, my cherished child? Yes, a hundred
times, a thousand times more than ever before."</p>

<p>"Violette," said Ourson, "never fear being ugly in our<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[261]</a></span>
eyes. To my eyes, you are a hundred times more beautiful
than when clothed with all your loveliness. To me you are
a sister&mdash;a friend incomparable. You will always be the
companion of my life, the ideal of my heart."</p>

<h3 class="chapter2"><a name="THE_COMBAT" id="THE_COMBAT"></a>THE COMBAT</h3>


<p><span class="dropcap">V</span><span class="upper">iolette</span> was about to reply, when a kind of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[262]</a></span>
roaring was heard in the air, and they saw descend
a chariot made of crocodile's skin, drawn by fifty
enormous toads. All the toads were hissing and blowing,
and would have cast their infectious venom in every direction,
if they had not been restrained by the power of the fairy
Drolette.</p>

<p>When the chariot reached the ground, the fairy Furious,
a huge and heavy creature, issued from it. Her big eyes
seemed bursting from their sockets, her large flat nose covered
her wrinkled, withered cheeks, her monstrous mouth
extended from ear to ear and when it was open a long pointed
black tongue was seen licking her horrid teeth.</p>

<p>She was not more than three feet in height and was very
corpulent; her grizzly skin was gluey and cold, like a snail's
and her thin red hair fell in locks of unequal length around<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[263]</a></span>
her throat, which was disfigured by a goitre. Her large,
flat hands looked like the fins of a shark, her dress was made
of snail's skins and her mantle of the skins of toads.</p>

<p>She advanced towards Ourson (who shall hereafter
be known by his true name of <span class="smcap">Prince Marvellous</span>) with a
slow step. She paused in front of him and casting a furious
glance upon the fairy Drolette and an eye of mocking
triumph upon Violette, she folded her great cold arms and
said in a sharp yet hoarse voice:&mdash;</p>

<p>"My sister has triumphed over me, Prince Marvellous.
I have, however, one consolation: you will not be happy,
because you have obtained your original beauty at the expense
of that little fool, who is now frightful and repugnant
and whom you will now never wish to approach. Yes! yes!
weep, my handsome Ourson! You will weep a long time,
Violette, and you will regret bitterly, if you do not already
regret, that you have given your beautiful skin to the prince
Marvellous."</p>

<p>"Never, madam, never! My only regret is that I did
not know sooner what I could do to testify my gratitude."</p>

<p>The fairy Drolette, whose countenance had assumed an
unaccustomed expression of severity and irritation, now
waved her wand and said:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Silence, sister! You shall not triumph long over the
misfortunes of Violette. I will provide a remedy for those
misfortunes: her generous devotion merits recompense."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[264]</a></span></p>

<p>"I defy you to come to her assistance under penalty of
my wrath," said Furious.</p>

<p>"I do not doubt your rage, sister, but I disdain to punish
you for it," replied Drolette.</p>

<p>"To punish me!&mdash;Do you dare to threaten me?" said
Furious. And hissing furiously, she called her chariot,
mounted it, rose in the air and tried to launch upon Drolette
all the venom of her toads in order to suffocate her.</p>

<p>But Drolette knew her sister perfectly. Her faithful
larks held the door of her chariot open and she sprang
within. The larks rose in the air, hovered above the toads,
and then lowered themselves rapidly upon them. The toads,
in spite of their weight, escaped the blows by turning adroitly
to one side. They however threw their venom on the larks
which were nearest to them, who died instantly.</p>

<p>Drolette detached them with the rapidity of a thunder-bolt,
rose again in the air and fell so adroitly on the toads,
that the larks tore out their eyes with their claws, before
Furious had time to come to the rescue of her army.</p>

<p>The outcries of the toads and the hissing of the larks
made a deafening noise; and the fairy Drolette called out to
her friends, who were regarding the combat with terror:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Withdraw immediately and stop your ears!"</p>

<p>Which was done instantly, in obedience to her command.</p>

<p>The fairy Furious made one last effort. She guided her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[265]</a></span>
blinded toads in such a way as to meet the larks face to face,
and to dart their venom upon them.</p>

<p>But Drolette rose higher and higher in the air and
Furious found herself always under her sister's chariot.</p>

<p>At last, unable to contain her rage, Furious cried out:&mdash;</p>

<p>"You are assisted by the queen of the fairies, an old fool
whom I should gladly see in the lower regions!"</p>

<p>Scarcely had she pronounced these words when her
chariot fell heavily to the earth. The toads perished and the
chariot disappeared. The fairy Furious only remained, in
the form of an enormous toad. She wished to speak but she
could only bellow and snuffle. She gazed at Drolette and
her larks&mdash;at Prince Marvellous, Violette and Agnella, in a
transport of rage but her power was destroyed.</p>

<p>The fairy Drolette lowered her chariot, descended to the
earth and said:&mdash;</p>

<p>"The queen of the fairies has punished you for your
audacity, sister. Repent, if you wish to obtain pardon."</p>

<p>The only answer of Furious was to spit forth her
poisonous venom, which happily reached no one.</p>

<p>Drolette extended her wand towards her and said:</p>

<p>"I command you to disappear and never to appear again
to the prince Marvellous, to Violette or to their mother."</p>

<p>Drolette had scarcely uttered these words when the toad
disappeared; there remained no vestige of the chariot or of
herself.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[266]</a></span></p>

<p>Drolette remained some time motionless. She passed
her hand over her brow, as if to chase away a sad thought;
then approaching Prince Marvellous, she said to him:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Prince, the title which I give you indicates your birth.
You are the son of King Ferocious and the queen Aimee,
concealed till now under the appearance of a modest farmer
woman. The name of your father sufficiently indicates his
character. Your mother having prevented him from killing
his brother Indolent and his sister-in-law Nonchalante, he
turned his rage against her. I was her protectress, and
carried her off with her faithful Passerose in a cloud.</p>

<p>"And you, Princess Violette, your birth is equal to that
of Prince Marvellous. Your father and mother were that
same King Indolent and Queen Nonchalante who, saved
once by Queen Aimee, became at last the victims of King
Ferocious and their own apathy. Since that time King
Ferocious has been killed by his subjects who could no
longer support his cruel yoke.</p>

<p>"They expect you, prince, to reign over them. I have
revealed to them your existence and I have promised them
that you will take a wife worthy of you. You can select
from the twelve princesses whom your father retained captive
after having slain their parents. They are all wise
and beautiful and each has a kingdom for her marriage
portion."</p>

<p>Surprise had kept Prince Marvellous silent. At the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[267]</a></span>
last words of the fairy he turned towards Violette, and seeing
that she was weeping, he said:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Why do you weep, my Violette? Do you fear that I
will blush for you&mdash;that I will not dare to testify before my
whole court the tenderness with which you inspire me?
That I will conceal what you have done for me or forget the
bonds which attach me to you for ever? Can you believe
that I will be ungrateful enough to seek any other affection
than yours and fill your place by any of those princesses held
captive by my father? No, dearest Violette! Until this
time I have seen in you only a sister but from this moment
you are the companion of my life, my sole friend, my
wife!"</p>

<p>"Your wife, dear brother? That is impossible! How
can you seat upon your throne a creature so repulsive as
your poor Violette? How will you dare to brave the raillery
of your subjects and of the neighboring kings? And how
could I show my deformity in the midst of the festivals given
on your return to your kingdom? No, no, my brother!
Let me live near you, near to your mother, alone, unknown,
covered with a veil. I cannot be your wife! No one shall
blame you for having made so sad a choice."</p>

<p>The prince insisted long and firmly. Violette could
scarcely control her emotions but she resisted with as much
resolution as devotion. Agnella said nothing. She would
have been willing that her son should accept even this last<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[268]</a></span>
sacrifice from poor Violette and simply allow her to live near
to them but hidden from the world.</p>

<p>Passerose wept and in a low tone encouraged the prince
in his determination.</p>

<p>"Violette," said the prince, at last, "since you absolutely
refuse to ascend the throne with me, I abandon
it and all royal power in order to live with you as before
in solitude and happiness. Without your sweet presence,
the sceptre would be a heavy burden; with you at my side,
our little farm will be a paradise! Say, dear Violette, shall
it be so?"</p>

<p>"Yes, dear brother, you have triumphed; let us live as
we have lived so many years: modest in our lives, happy in
our affections."</p>

<p>"Noble prince and generous princess," said the fairy,
"you shall be recompensed for this rare and devoted tenderness.
Prince, in the well to which I carried you during the
fire, there is a priceless treasure for Violette and yourself.
Descend into the well, seek for it, and when you have found
it bring it to me. I will teach you its value."</p>

<p>The prince did not wait to be told a second time; he ran
towards the well; the ladder was still there and he descended.
On arriving at the bottom, he saw nothing but the carpet
which had been there from the first; he searched the walls of
the well, but saw no indication of treasure. Finally he
raised the carpet, and perceived a black stone with a ring<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[269]</a></span>
attached; he raised the stone and discovered a casket which
glittered like a constellation.</p>

<p>"This must contain the treasure spoken of by the fairy,"
said he.</p>

<p>The prince seized the casket; it was as light as a nutshell.
He ascended the ladder hastily, holding the casket
carefully in his arms.</p>

<p>They were awaiting his return with impatience. He
handed the casket to the fairy. Agnella exclaimed:&mdash;</p>

<p>"This is the same casket you confided to me, madam,
and which I supposed I had lost in the fire."</p>

<p>"It is the same," replied the fairy. "Here is the key;
open it, prince."</p>

<p>Prince Marvellous hastened to open it. But who can
describe the general disappointment, when, in place of some
rich treasure which they supposed it contained, they found
only the bracelets which Violette had worn when her cousin
found her sleeping in the wood, and a vial of perfumed oil!</p>

<p>The fairy looked from one to the other, and enjoyed
their surprise and consternation. She took the bracelets and
gave them to Violette.</p>

<p>"This is my bridal present, my dear child; every one of
these diamonds has the property of guarding from all evil
influences the person who wears it, and of endowing its
wearer with every virtue, enormous riches and resplendent
beauty, with wit, intellect and all desirable happiness. Use<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[270]</a></span>
them for the children who will be born of your union with
Prince Marvellous.</p>

<p>"As to this vial of perfumed oil, it is the wedding gift of
the prince your cousin. I know you love perfumes, this
has peculiar virtues; use it to-day. To-morrow I will return
to seek you and carry you all to your kingdom," she said.</p>

<p>"I renounce my kingdom, madam," said Ourson.</p>

<p>"Who will govern your people?" said Agnella.</p>

<p>"You, my mother, if you are willing," replied Ourson.</p>

<p>The queen was about to refuse, when the fairy interfered.</p>

<p>"We will speak of this to-morrow," said she. "You,
madam, I know, desire to accept the crown which you are
about to refuse. I forbid you, however, to accept it before
my return. And you, dear and amiable prince," added she,
in a sweet voice, accompanied with an affectionate glance,
"I forbid you to repeat this offer before my return. Adieu
till to-morrow. When you are truly happy, my dear children,
think kindly of your friend the fairy Drolette."</p>

<p>The fairy ascended her chariot. The larks flew like
lightning and she soon disappeared, leaving behind her a delicious
perfume.</p>

<h3 class="chapter2"><a name="THE_RECOMPENSE" id="THE_RECOMPENSE"></a>THE RECOMPENSE</h3>


<p><span class="dropcap">P</span><span class="upper">rince</span> Marvellous looked at Violette and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[271]</a></span>
sighed heavily; Violette gazed at the prince and
smiled sweetly.</p>

<p>"How handsome you are, my dear cousin! I am so
happy to have it in my power to restore you your beauty.
And now I will pour some of this perfumed oil upon my
hands; since I cannot please your eye, I will at least embalm
you," said she, laughing.</p>

<p>She uncorked the vial, and entreated Marvellous to
sprinkle some drops on her forehead and cheeks. The heart
of the prince was too full for words. He took the vial and
obeyed the order of his cousin. Their surprise and joy
were indescribable on seeing that as soon as the oil touched
Violette's forehead the hair disappeared and her skin resumed
its original purity and dazzling whiteness.</p>

<p>The prince and Violette, on seeing the virtue of this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[272]</a></span>
wonderful oil, uttered loud cries of delight and ran towards
the stable where they saw Agnella and Passerose. They
called their attention to the happy effect of this perfumed oil
given them by the fairy. Both joined in their happiness.
The prince could scarcely believe the evidence of his senses.
And now nothing could prevent his union with Violette, so
good, so devoted, so tender, so lovely, so well constituted to
make him supremely happy.</p>

<p>The queen thought of the morrow&mdash;of her return to her
kingdom, which she had abandoned twenty years ago. She
wished that she herself, that Violette, that her son the prince
had clothing worthy of so great an occasion but, alas! she
had neither the time nor the means to procure them: they
would therefore be compelled to wear their coarse clothing,
and thus show themselves to their people. Violette and
Marvellous laughed at this distress of their mother.</p>

<p>"Do you not think, mamma," said Violette, "that our
dear prince is sufficiently adorned with his rare beauty and
that a rich and royal robe would not make him more beautiful
or more amiable?"</p>

<p>"And do you not agree with me, my dear mother," said
Marvellous, "in thinking that our dear Violette is lovely
enough in the simplest clothing, that the lustre of her eyes
surpasses the most brilliant diamonds, that the clear whiteness
of her teeth rivals successfully the rarest pearls, that the
richness of her blonde hair surpasses a crown of brilliants?"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[273]</a></span></p>

<p>"Yes, yes, my children," replied Agnella, "without
doubt, you are both of you handsome and attractive but a rich
dress spoils nothing, not even beauty. Jewels, embroidery
and heavy brocades would detract nothing from your charms.
And I who am old&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"But not ugly, madam," interrupted Passerose, hastily.
"You are still amiable and handsome, in spite of your little
country cap, your skirts of coarse striped cloth, your waist of
red camlet and your stomacher of simple cloth. Besides,
when you return to your kingdom, you can buy every kind
of dress your heart desires."</p>

<p>The evening passed away gayly and there seemed no
anxiety about the future. The fairy had provided their supper;
they passed the night on the bundles of hay in the stable
and as they were all fatigued by the emotions of the day they
slept profoundly. The sun had been shining a long time
and the fairy Drolette was with them, before they awoke.</p>

<p>A soft "Hem! hem!" of the fairy aroused them. The
prince was the first to open his eyes; he threw himself on his
knees before the fairy and thanked her with such warmth
and gratitude that her heart was touched.</p>

<p>Violette was on her knees by his side and joining her
thanks to those of the prince.</p>

<p>"I do not doubt your gratitude, dear children," said the
fairy; "but I have much to do. I am expected in the kingdom
of the king Benin where I am to attend at the birth of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[274]</a></span>
the third son of the princess Blondine. This prince is to be
the husband of your first daughter, Prince Marvellous, and
I am resolved to endow him with all the qualities which will
obtain for him the warm love of your daughter. And now I
must conduct you to your kingdom; I will return in time to
be present at your wedding. Queen," she continued, turning
to Aimee, who was now just opening her eyes, "we are
about to set out immediately for your son's kingdom. Are
you and your faithful Passerose ready for the journey?"</p>

<p>"Madam," replied the queen, with a slight embarrassment,
"we are ready to follow you but will you not blush for
our dress, so little worthy of our rank?"</p>

<p>"It is not I who will blush, queen," said the fairy,
smiling, "but rather yourself who have this sensation of
shame. But I will remedy this evil also."</p>

<p>Saying this, she described a circle with her wand above
the head of the queen, who in the same moment found herself
clothed in a robe of gold brocade. Upon her head was a hat
with splendid plumes, fastened with a band of superb
diamonds and her boots were of velvet, spangled with gold.</p>

<p>Aimee looked at her robe with an air of complaisance.</p>

<p>"And Violette and my son the prince, will you not extend
your goodness to them also?"</p>

<p>"Violette and the prince have asked for nothing. I will
do as they wish. Speak, Violette, do you desire to change
your costume?"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[275]</a></span></p>

<p>"Madam," replied Violette, casting down her sweet eyes
and blushing, "I have been sufficiently happy in this robe of
simple cloth. In this costume my brother knew me and
loved me. Permit me to continue to wear it as far as regard
for my station allows and allow me to preserve it always in
remembrance of the happy years of my childhood."</p>

<p>The prince thanked Violette for these sweet words, and
pressed her hand tenderly.</p>

<p>The fairy kindly nodded her approval and called for her
chariot, which was waiting a few steps from them. She entered
and placed the queen next herself, then the prince,
Violette and Passerose.</p>

<p>In less than an hour the larks had flown over the three
thousand leagues which separated them from the kingdom of
Prince Marvellous. All his court and all his subjects, apprised
beforehand by the fairy, expected him. The streets
and the palaces were filled by the eager, happy crowd.</p>

<p>When the chariot appeared in sight, the people uttered
cries of joy which were redoubled when it drew up before the
great entrance of the palace, when they saw descend Queen
Aimee, a little older, no doubt, but still pretty and gracious,
and the Prince Marvellous, whose natural beauty and grace
were enhanced by the splendor of his clothing, glittering
with gold and precious stones, which were also a present
from the fairy.</p>

<p>But the acclamations arose to frenzy when the prince,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[276]</a></span>
taking Violette by the hand, presented her to the people.</p>

<p>Her sweet, attractive countenance, her superb and elegant
form, were adorned with a dress with which the fairy
had clothed her by one stroke of her wand.</p>

<p>Her robe was of gold lace, while her waist, her arms and
shoulders shone with innumerable larks formed of diamonds
larger than humming-birds. On her graceful head she wore
a crown of larks made of precious stones of all colors. Her
countenance, soft but gay, her grace, her beauty, won the
hearts of all.</p>

<p>For a long time nothing was heard but shouts of "Long
live King Marvellous! Long live Queen Violette!" The
noise and tumult were so great that many persons became
deaf. The good fairy, who desired that only joy and happiness
should prevail throughout the kingdom on this auspicious
day, cured them instantly at the request of Violette.</p>

<p>There was a magnificent feast spread for the court and
the people. A million, three hundred and forty-six thousand,
eight hundred and twenty-two persons dined at the
expense of the fairy and each guest was permitted to carry
away enough for eight days.</p>

<p>During the repast the fairy set off for the kingdom of
King Benin, promising to return in time for the wedding of
Marvellous and Violette. During the eight days of the
fairy's absence Marvellous, who saw that his mother was a
little sad at not being queen, entreated her earnestly to accept<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[277]</a></span>
Violette's kingdom and she consented to reign there on condition
that King Marvellous and Queen Violette would come
every year and pass three months with her.</p>

<p>Queen Aimee, before parting with her children, wished
to witness their marriage. The fairy Drolette and many
other fairies of her acquaintance and many genii were invited
to the marriage. They all received the most magnificent
presents, and were so satisfied with the welcome given
them by King Marvellous and Queen Violette that they
graciously promised to return whenever they were invited.</p>

<p>Two years afterwards they received an invitation to be
present at the birth of the first child of King Marvellous.
There came to Queen Violette a daughter, who, like her
mother, was a marvel of goodness and beauty.</p>

<p>The king and queen could not fulfil the promise they
had made to Queen Aimee. One of the genii who had been
invited to the wedding of Marvellous and Violette, found in
Queen Aimee so much of goodness, sweetness, and beauty,
that he loved her, and, visiting her several times in her new
kingdom and being affectionately and graciously received
by her, he carried her off one day in a whirlwind. Queen
Aimee wept for a while but as she loved the genius she was
not inconsolable; indeed, she promptly consented to wed
him. The king of the genii granted to her as a wedding
present the power of participating in all the privileges of her
husband: never to die, never to grow old and the ability to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[278]</a></span>
transport herself in the twinkling of an eye wherever she
wished to go. Aimee used this power very often to visit her
son and his children.</p>

<p>King Marvellous and Queen Violette had eight sons
and four daughters and they were all charming. They were
happy, without doubt, for they loved each other tenderly and
their grandmother, who, it was said spoiled them a little induced
their grandfather, the genius Bienveillant, to contribute
all in his power to their happiness. Consequently,
they received many rich gifts.</p>

<p>Passerose, who was warmly attached to Queen Aimee,
had followed her into her new kingdom but when the genius
carried her off in a whirlwind, Passerose, seeing herself forgotten
and not being able to follow her mistress was so sad in
the loneliness caused by the departure of Aimee, that she
prayed the fairy Drolette to transport her to the kingdom of
King Marvellous and Queen Violette. She remained with
them and took care of their children to whom she often recounted
the adventures of Ourson and Violette. She still
remains, it is said, though the genius and his queen have
made her many excuses for not having carried her off in the
whirlwind.</p>

<p>"No, no," Passerose replied to all these explanations;
"let us remain as we are. You forgot me once&mdash;you might
forget me another time. Here, my dear Ourson and my
sweet Violette never forget their old nurse. I love them and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[279]</a></span>
I will remain with them. They loved me and they will take
care of me."</p>

<p>The farmer, the superintendent, and the master of the
forge who had been so cruel to Ourson were severely
punished by the fairy Drolette.</p>

<p>The farmer was devoured by a bear, some hours after he
had chased away Ourson.</p>

<p>The superintendent was dismissed by his master for having
let loose the dogs, who escaped and never could be found.
The same night he was bitten by a venomous serpent and expired
some moments afterwards.</p>

<p>The master of the forge having reprimanded his workmen
too brutally, they resolved upon vengeance: seized him
and cast him into the blazing furnace where he perished
miserably.</p>
